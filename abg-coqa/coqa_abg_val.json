She also is accused of stealing her victims' belongings. \n\nHer attorney, Mark Howard, said his client \"categorically denies that she committed any acts of genocide, or committed any crimes, as the prosecution alleges here.\" ",

Faye Wong and her husband Li Yapeng started the Yan Ran Angel Foundation for harelipped children three years ago. It was named after their daughter. Its purpose is to help children under 14 to cure their harelips. The couple donated one million yuan (about $ 133,000) to start the organization. Cong Fei was born in a poor family. He became a successful singer in Shenzhen. He helped 178 poor students and disabled people for more than 10 years. Before he died of an illness at the age of 37 in 2006, he decided to donate his cornea to people with eye problems. He helped six people see the world. Guan Mucun has donated money to Project Hope to help poor students finish primary education. Thirty of these poor students have already finished high school with her support. Guan has also helped with charity work for environment protection, HIV/AIDS prevention, blood donation and \"Mother Water\". Guan had an unlucky childhood: her mother died when she was only 10 years old. With the help of the government and her neighbours, she grew up and was successful as a famous singer. Action star Jackie Chan is a wholehearted supporter of charities including UNICEF, Operation Smile and his own Jackie Chan Charitable Foundation. In 2007, he used much of his spare time to visit the farthest parts of China on his Dragon's Heart Charity Missions. The Dragon's Heart Foundation aims to meet the needs of poor children and the elderly in the hardest-to-reach areas of the country. Chan has made several trips to these poor villages, bringing warm clothing, wheelchairs and school supplies, and helping to build schools.",

      "story": "A few years ago, Paul Gerner began to gather a group of architects in Las Vegas to ask them what it would take to design a public school that used 50 percent less energy, cost much less to build and obviously improved student learning. \"I think half of them fell off their chairs,\" Gerner says. \n\nGerner manages school facilities for Clark County, Nevada, a district roughly the size of Massachusetts. By 2018, 143,000 additional students will enter the already crowded public-education system. Gerner needs 73 new schools to house them. Four architecture teams have nearly finished designing primary school prototypes ; they plan to construct their schools starting in 2009. The district will then assess how well the schools perform, and three winners will copy those designs in 50 to 70 new buildings. \n\nGreen schools are appearing all over, but in Clark County, which stands out for its vastness, such aggressive targets are difficult because design requirements like more natural light for students go against the realities of a desert climate. \"One of the biggest challenges is getting the right site orientation ,\" Mark. McGinty, a director at SH Architecture, says. His firm recently completed a high school in Las Vegas. \"You have the same building, same set of windows, but if its orientation is incorrect and it faces the sun, it will be really expensive to cool.\" \n\nSurprisingly, the man responsible for one of re most progressive green-design competitions has doubts about ideas of eco-friendly buildings. \"I don't believe in the new green religion,\" Gerner says. \"Some of the building technologies that you get are impractical. I'm interested in those that work.\" But he wouldn't mind if some green features inspire students. He says he hopes to set up green energy systems that allow them to learn about the process of harvesting wind and solar power. \"You never know what's going to start the interest of a child to study math and science,\" he says.",

      "story": "The world produces about 4 billion metric tons of food a year but 1.2 to 2 billion tons is not eaten, the study by the London-based Institution of Mechanical Engineers said. It is instead thrown away. Experts say food is wasted in both rich and poor countries, but for different reasons. \n\nElliot Woolley teaches sustainable manufacturing at Loughborough University in Britain. He spoke at the Global Conference on Sustainable Manufacturing, which was held earlier this month in Vietnam. \n\nMr. Woolley said in poor countries, food is usually lost while it is still in the field or during storage and transportation. He said that is because food producers there are inefficient. These businesses are unable to operate effectively without wasting materials, time or energy. But he added that once food is sold in developing countries, people usually eat everything they buy. \n\nHowever, people in developed countries throw away as much as half of the food they purchase. In the US, big contributors to waste include supersized portions that customers simply can't manage, and\"eat as much as you want\"offers in restaurants. In the UK, over-conservative sell-by dates on labels and two-for-one offers of perishable items are key factors, encouraging consumers to buy too much food to start with and to throw away items that have reached their sell-by date, but which are still edible. And efficient farming methods, transport and storage mean that most of the wastage occurs through retail and customer behavior. The British researcher called this custom\"adisgrace\". \n\nElliot Woolley has created a smartphone app that he says shows users what food they have bought and when the food is about to become unsafe to eat. It also gives information on how people can combine the foods they have to make a meal. The software program is called\"Pantry App\". \n\nMr. Woolley said that people who used the app reduced the amount of food they wasted by a third. But this result came from a limited experiment -- users only followed their food use for a week. \n\nJeremy Bonvoisin is a student at the Technical University of Berlin. He attended the recent conference in Vietnam. He said one way to solve the problem of wasting food is to take steps to persuade people to stop buying so much food in the first place. He said people buy more food than they need because it is becoming less costly. They waste so much food because they buy more than they need. \n\nHe said the new app could help those who already want to change the way they use the food they buy. But he is also worried that it could get people to waste more food because they no longer have to pay attention to how much they have bought.",

      "story": "(CNN) -- The ouster of Tunisia's longtime ruler has cast a shadow over the surrounding region, but few analysts were willing to predict Tuesday that the revolt would spread to other countries. \n\nZine El Abidine Ben Ali was Tunisia's president for 23 years before Friday, when weeks of protests forced him into exile in Saudi Arabia. Tunisians complained that the president's family and supporters had grown rich while their living conditions stagnated and their voices were stifled. \n\nBut while the governments of nearby nations like Algeria, Libya and Egypt face similar criticism, the level of repression and the concentration of power and corruption were far more extreme in Tunisia, said Nathan Brown, a professor of Middle Eastern politics at George Washington University in Washington. \n\n\"I think most regimes in the region are viewed with a mix of disdain and resignation by their population,\" Brown said. Few may support their government, but \"It's not as if there's much that can be done about it,\" he said. \n\nNeighboring Algeria was also wracked by rioting last week, triggered by the spiraling costs of basic food items after its government slashed price supports for staples like milk, oil and sugar. State-run media reported at least three people had died in the clashes. \n\nLibya's longtime strongman, Moammar Gadhafi, mourned Ben Ali's ouster and warned in a nationally televised speech that Tunisia was facing \"unjustified chaos.\" And in Egypt, at least two people have set themselves afire in public this week -- the same type of protest that triggered Tunisia's demonstrations in December.

She didn't die, though, and was able to return home, ravaged and five months pregnant. When she got home she was branded a \"slut.\" \n\nWe also thought of starting with the story of Ester Abeja, a woman in Uganda who was forcibly held as a \"bush wife\" by the Lord's Resistance Army. Repeated rape with objects destroyed her insides. Her captors also made her kill her 1-year-old daughter by smashing the baby's head into a tree. \n\nWe ran through a dozen other stories of women like Begum and Abeja, and finally realized that it would be too difficult to find the right one -- the tale that would express exactly how and in what ways sexualized violence is being used as a weapon of war to devastate women and tear apart communities around the world, conflict by conflict, from Libya to the Democratic Republic of Congo. \n\nIt is because of this complexity that we must understand how sexualized violence is being used. We must understand in order to stop it -- just as, when seeking to defuse a bomb, it is crucial to know its components. Both the World Health Organization and the U.N. Security Council have recognized that there is a lack of research on the nature and extent of sexualized violence in conflict, even as there is increasing demand from U.N. bodies, donors, and others for better analysis to work toward prevention and healing.

Because of their relative simplicity, reference ellipsoids are used as a preferred surface on which geodetic network computations are performed and point coordinates such as latitude, longitude, and elevation are defined. \n\nIn 1687 Isaac Newton published the Principia in which he included a proof that a rotating self-gravitating fluid body in equilibrium takes the form of an oblate ellipsoid of revolution which he termed an oblate spheroid. Current practice uses the word 'ellipsoid' alone in preference to the full term 'oblate ellipsoid of revolution' or the older term 'oblate spheroid'. In the rare instances (some asteroids and planets) where a more general ellipsoid shape is required as a model the term used is triaxial (or scalene) ellipsoid. A great many ellipsoids have been used with various sizes and centres but modern (post-GPS) ellipsoids are centred at the actual center of mass of the Earth or body being modeled. \n\nThe shape of an (oblate) ellipsoid (of revolution) is determined by the shape parameters of that ellipse which generates the ellipsoid when it is rotated about its minor axis. The semi-major axis of the ellipse, \"a\", is identified as the equatorial radius of the ellipsoid: the semi-minor axis of the ellipse, \"b\", is identified with the polar distances (from the centre). These two lengths completely specify the shape of the ellipsoid but in practice geodesy publications classify reference ellipsoids by giving the semi-major axis and the \"inverse \"flattening, , The flattening, \"f\", is simply a measure of how much the symmetry axis is compressed relative to the equatorial radius: For the Earth, \"f\" is around corresponding to a difference of the major and minor semi-axes of approximately . Some precise values are given in the table below and also in Figure of the Earth. For comparison, Earth's Moon is even less elliptical, with a flattening of less than , while Jupiter is visibly oblate at about and one of Saturn's triaxial moons, Telesto, is nearly to .",

      "story": "Scientists do not know the exact cause of sexual orientation, but they believe that it is caused by a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences. They favor biologically-based theories, which point to genetic factors, the early uterine environment, both, or the inclusion of genetic and social factors. There is no substantive evidence which suggests parenting or early childhood experiences play a role when it comes to sexual orientation. Research over several decades has demonstrated that sexual orientation ranges along a continuum, from exclusive attraction to the opposite sex to exclusive attraction to the same sex. \n\nSexual identity and sexual behavior are closely related to sexual orientation, but they are distinguished, with sexual identity referring to an individual's conception of themselves, behavior referring to actual sexual acts performed by the individual, and orientation referring to \"fantasies, attachments and longings.\" Individuals may or may not express their sexual orientation in their behaviors. People who have a homosexual sexual orientation that does not align with their sexual identity are sometimes referred to as 'closeted'. The term may, however, reflect a certain cultural context and particular stage of transition in societies which are gradually dealing with integrating sexual minorities. In studies related to sexual orientation, when dealing with the degree to which a person's sexual attractions, behaviors and identity match, scientists usually use the terms concordance or discordance. Thus, a woman who is attracted to other women, but calls herself heterosexual and only has sexual relations with men, can be said to experience discordance between her sexual orientation (homosexual or lesbian) and her sexual identity and behaviors (heterosexual).",

Before 1817 deaf people communicated by using \"home signs\". Gestures were individually created and used within the home for simple communication. There were no schools or formal sign language training for the deaf. \n\nSo, why was 1817 an important date? Well, the story begins with Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet. Gallaudet met his neighbor's daughter Alice Cogswell. Alice was the young deaf daughter of Dr. Mason Cogswell from Hartford, Connecticut. Gallaudet began teaching Alice to read and write a few simple words. Excited by the success Dr. Cogswell encouraged Gallaudet to establish a school for the deaf. Cogswell raised the money and Gallaudet traveled to Britain to learn the methods used there. However, the schools refused to share their instructional techniques and methods. \n\nWhile in London, there happened to be a demonstration of the French method of deaf education. Britain was using an oral method of instruction; however, the French method used signs. Gallaudet was fascinated with the method and was able to meet with the instructor, Sicard, and his two deaf pupils, Jean Massieu and Laurent Clerc. Sicard agreed to teach Gallaudet his method and Gallaudet went to Paris to learn French signs. After a while, Gallaudet wished to return home and convinced Clerc to go with him and help him establish the school. The trip home was a 52-day voyage during which Clerc taught Gallaudet French signs and Gallaudet taught Clerc English. \n\nOn April 15, 1817, Laurent Clerc and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet established what is currently known as the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut. The opening of the first school for the deaf can be viewed as one of the most important events in current deaf culture.",

Gallaudet met his neighbor's daughter Alice Cogswell. Alice was the young deaf daughter of Dr. Mason Cogswell from Hartford, Connecticut. Gallaudet began teaching Alice to read and write a few simple words. Excited by the success Dr. Cogswell encouraged Gallaudet to establish a school for the deaf. Cogswell raised the money and Gallaudet traveled to Britain to learn the methods used there. However, the schools refused to share their instructional techniques and methods. \n\nWhile in London, there happened to be a demonstration of the French method of deaf education. Britain was using an oral method of instruction; however, the French method used signs. Gallaudet was fascinated with the method and was able to meet with the instructor, Sicard, and his two deaf pupils, Jean Massieu and Laurent Clerc. Sicard agreed to teach Gallaudet his method and Gallaudet went to Paris to learn French signs. After a while, Gallaudet wished to return home and convinced Clerc to go with him and help him establish the school. The trip home was a 52-day voyage during which Clerc taught Gallaudet French signs and Gallaudet taught Clerc English. \n\nOn April 15, 1817, Laurent Clerc and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet established what is currently known as the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut. The opening of the first school for the deaf can be viewed as one of the most important events in current deaf culture.",

Art Deco influenced the design of buildings, furniture, jewellery, fashion, cars, movie theatres, trains, ocean liners, and everyday objects such as radios and vacuum cleaners. It took its name, short for \"Arts D\u00e9coratifs\", from the Exposition Internationale des Arts D\u00e9coratifs et Industriels Modernes (International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts) held in Paris in 1925. It combined modernist styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials. During its heyday, Art Deco represented luxury, glamour, exuberance, and faith in social and technological progress. \n\nArt Deco was a pastiche of many different styles, sometimes contradictory, united by a desire to be modern. From its outset, Art Deco was influenced by the bold geometric forms of Cubism; the bright colors of Fauvism and of the Ballets Russes; the updated craftsmanship of the furniture of the eras of Louis Philippe and Louis XVI; and the exotic styles of China and Japan, India, Persia, ancient Egypt and Maya art. It featured rare and expensive materials, such as ebony and ivory, and exquisite craftsmanship. The Chrysler Building and other skyscrapers of New York built during the 1920s and 1930s are monuments of the Art Deco style.",

The Coast Guard is a maritime, military, multi-mission service unique among the U.S. military branches for having a maritime law enforcement mission (with jurisdiction in both domestic and international waters) and a federal regulatory agency mission as part of its mission set. It operates under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during peacetime, and can be transferred to the U.S. Department of the Navy by the U.S. President at any time, or by the U.S. Congress during times of war. This has happened twice, in 1917, during World War I, and in 1941, during World War II. \n\nCreated by Congress on 4 August 1790 at the request of Alexander Hamilton as the Revenue Marine, it is the oldest continuous seagoing service of the United States. As Secretary of the Treasury, Hamilton headed the Revenue Marine, whose original purpose was collecting customs duties in the nation's seaports. By the 1860s, the service was known as the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and the term Revenue Marine gradually fell into disuse. \n\nThe modern Coast Guard was formed by a merger of the Revenue Cutter Service and the U.S. Life-Saving Service on 28 January 1915, under the U.S. Department of the Treasury. As one of the country's five armed services, the Coast Guard has been involved in every U.S. war from 1790 to the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan. the Coast Guard had over 36,000 men and women on active duty, 7,350 reservists, 29,620 auxiliarists, and 7,064 full-time civilian employees.

Thanksgiving had been celebrated only two days before. Since it was a holiday weekend I had been on the phone with Greg the night before many times. His dad didn't want him to come over because of the holiday. I guess he finally wore him down and he called and said, \"I can stay\". So, my mom, brother, and I went to pick him up. He was always smiling. The complete opposite of my shy self, Greg was always the life of the party. \n\nWe got two large pizzas that Friday night. I've never known anyone in my entire life who loved to eat more than Greg. That's the way he was though. He was just enjoying life. And if it meant gaining weight or whatever, so be it. He would sit back and put his hands on his belly and just laugh. We (Greg, David, and I) did so many funny things together and had such great times. Things we should have done and things we shouldn't have done, I'll \"Never\" forget. \n\nOn Saturday morning Dad took us out for breakfast. We all finished eating and followed my Dad up to the cashier. Greg asked Dad if he could have a candy bar. I looked at Greg shaking my head. He just laughed. After breakfast, Father took us to my Mom's house. \n\nWhen we got out at Mom's house there was no one home. So, one of us grabbed a big wheel and rode it down the steep driveway into the street. Just boys being boys. Greg and I did it several times until the last time. The car hit him on the head, knocking him around 75-- 100 yards. My brother and I both ran screaming just yelling for help and crying. One of the neighbors called 911. I was in shock. That day was forever etched into our memories. \n\nIt still hurts to think about it. Wishing we could have grown old together. Wondering how it would have been. I'm sure It WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT.",

      "story": "The story of the day I lost my best friend to a car accident. The day a precious life was taken from us way too soon. \n\nIt was a bright and Sunny day in November. Thanksgiving had been celebrated only two days before. Since it was a holiday weekend I had been on the phone with Greg the night before many times. His dad didn't want him to come over because of the holiday. I guess he finally wore him down and he called and said, \"I can stay\". So, my mom, brother, and I went to pick him up. He was always smiling. The complete opposite of my shy self, Greg was always the life of the party. \n\nWe got two large pizzas that Friday night. I've never known anyone in my entire life who loved to eat more than Greg. That's the way he was though. He was just enjoying life. And if it meant gaining weight or whatever, so be it. He would sit back and put his hands on his belly and just laugh. We (Greg, David, and I) did so many funny things together and had such great times. Things we should have done and things we shouldn't have done, I'll \"Never\" forget. \n\nOn Saturday morning Dad took us out for breakfast. We all finished eating and followed my Dad up to the cashier. Greg asked Dad if he could have a candy bar. I looked at Greg shaking my head. He just laughed. After breakfast, Father took us to my Mom's house. \n\nWhen we got out at Mom's house there was no one home. So, one of us grabbed a big wheel and rode it down the steep driveway into the street. Just boys being boys. Greg and I did it several times until the last time. The car hit him on the head, knocking him around 75-- 100 yards. My brother and I both ran screaming just yelling for help and crying. One of the neighbors called 911. I was in shock. That day was forever etched into our memories. \n\nIt still hurts to think about it. Wishing we could have grown old together. Wondering how it would have been. I'm sure It WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT.",

However, the Philippines, a predominantly Roman Catholic country, does not celebrate Carnival anymore since the dissolution of the Manila Carnival after 1939, the last carnival in the country. In historically Lutheran countries, the celebration is known as Fastelavn, and in areas with a high concentration of Anglicans and Methodists, pre-Lenten celebrations, along with penitential observances, occur on Shrove Tuesday. In Eastern Orthodox nations, Maslenitsa is celebrated during the last week before Great Lent. In German-speaking Europe and the Netherlands, the Carnival season traditionally opens on 11/11 (often at 11:11 a.m.). This dates back to celebrations before the Advent season or with harvest celebrations of St. Martin's Day. \n\nTraditionally a carnival feast was the last opportunity to eat well before the time of food shortage at the end of the winter during which one was limited to the minimum necessary. On what nowadays is called vastenavond (the days before fasting) all the remaining winter stores of lard, butter and meat which were left would be eaten, for it would soon start to rot and decay. The selected livestock had in fact already been slaughtered in November and the meat would be no longer preservable. All the food that had survived the winter had to be eaten to assure that everyone was fed enough to survive until the coming spring would provide new food sources.",

Sam was worried that he would not find a pet that would like him better than the other pets, but he knew he would find the pet for him. The pet store had a big, white door and Sam opened it up and heard lots of barking! He saw a nice man standing next to the dogs who said that his name was Chris. Sam said hello and petted the dogs. He really liked one of the dogs named Rocky, but Rocky did not like him. Chris said that Rocky was mean and did not like some people even when the people were very nice. Sam was a little sad, but he saw the next cage! There was a small, yellow dog in the cage named Button. Sam put his finger through the bars in Button's cage and Button licked his fingers. Sam laughed, and asked Chris to let him play with Buttons. Sam and Buttons played together in the grass outside of the store, and Sam was so happy. Buttons loved Sam, and Sam loved Buttons! Sam had some papers that he had to sign, and he showed Chris all of the toys and items he had bought to bring home with his new pet: Chris was so happy, too!

We are bringing out equipment to begin operations to sever the drillpipe, plugback the well and bypass,\" Scherie Douglas, a BP regulatory advisor, told the district engineer for the U.S. Interior Department's Minerals Management Service in a March 10 e-mail. \n\nIn a follow-up e-mail to the district engineer, Frank Patton, Douglas reported the company wanted to get a plug set in the well before testing the blowout preventer, the massive device used to shut down the well in case of an emergency. \n\n\"With the give and take of the well and hole behavior we would feel much more comfortable getting at least one of the two plugs set in order to fully secure the well prior to testing BOPs,\" she wrote. \n\nWhen Patton told BP he could not delay a test any longer than it took to bring the well under control, the company won a postponement from David Trocquet, the MMS district manager in New Orleans, Louisiana, the documents show. Trocquet ordered BP to make sure its cement plug was set up and to verify its placement, according to his reply. The messages do not indicate how long the test was postponed. \n\nThe exchange was among the documents released Sunday by leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is looking into the disaster that killed 11 workers aboard the drilling platform Deepwater Horizon and uncapped a gusher that is now fouling the northern Gulf of Mexico.

It was fun saying hello to everyone but he felt lonely sometimes. He wanted a pet to take care of. One day as he was walking down the road a little brown and spotted puppy came up to him and wanted James to pet him. James reached down and petted the puppy and smiled. James hoped to see the puppy again. Many days later James went for a walk again. He thought to himself, \"I guess I won't ever see the brown puppy again. I hoped to see him again.\" A nice young lady said to James, \"Would you like a puppy?\" James said, \"I would like a puppy that was like the one I petted before.\" The lady smiled. She was holding the little brown and spotted puppy. She told James that she found the little puppy in the woods. She said that the little puppy did not have a family. James said happily, \"I would love to give the puppy a home!\" So James grabbed the little brown and spotted puppy and took him home. James and the little brown puppy became great friends.

Founded by Methodists and Quakers in the present-day town of Trinity in 1838, the school moved to Durham in 1892. In 1924, tobacco and electric power industrialist James Buchanan Duke established The Duke Endowment, at which time the institution changed its name to honor his deceased father, Washington Duke. \n\nDuke's campus spans over on three contiguous campuses in Durham as well as a marine lab in Beaufort. The main campus\u2014designed largely by architect Julian Abele\u2014incorporates Gothic architecture with the Duke Chapel at the campus' center and highest point of elevation. The first-year-populated East Campus contains Georgian-style architecture, while the main Gothic-style West Campus away is adjacent to the Medical Center. Duke is the seventh-wealthiest private university in America with $11.4 billion in cash and investments in fiscal year 2014. \n\nDuke's research expenditures in the 2015 fiscal year were $1.037 billion, the seventh largest in the nation. In 2014, Thomson Reuters named 32 of Duke's professors to its list of Highly Cited Researchers, making it fourth globally in terms of primary affiliations. Duke also ranks fifth among national universities to have produced Rhodes, Marshall, Truman, Goldwater, and Udall Scholars. Ten Nobel laureates and three Turing Award winners are affiliated with the university. Duke's sports teams compete in the Atlantic Coast Conference and the basketball team is renowned for having won five NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championships, most recently in 2015.",

The noise was coming from a nearby tree. She walked over to the tree to take a look and found a puppy curled up by the roots. It was making a loud, sad noise. Sally bent down and picked up the puppy. It quickly quieted down, and licked her face. Sally laughed. The puppy was brown with white paws, and she thought it was the cutest puppy she ever saw. She couldn't find a tag on him, so she took him home. When she got home, she fed the puppy some meat that she had in her fridge. The puppy seemed to like it. She also gave him a bowl of water and he lapped it all up. Then the puppy yawned. Sally picked him up and brought him to her bed and put him on her pillow. Sally looked at him with a smile. \"I'm going to call you...Jackson.\" Jackson wagged his tail a little, and fell asleep.",

When she tried to walk, her legs twisted. \n\nAfter the operation, she adapted quickly. \"From day one, I basically jumped up and wanted to do everything,\" she says. Prosthetic legs allowed her to move around upright, but too slowly to keep up with her friends. Brittany's solution: take the legs off and walk on her knees---sometimes she still does when safety and comfort permit. \n\nShe's rarely _ . Other children laughed at her through the years, especially in junior high school, but she says the challenge only made her stronger. Now she's trying to convince her coaches to let her remove the prostheses and be a flyer, the cheerleader who's thrown in the air and caught by her teammates. \n\nBrittany doesn't think her problems are more difficult than the next person's. \"My disability was the first thing I had to get through, and that's going to prepare me for the future,\" she says. \"It's all just a test: If someone throws you a curve ball , what are you going to do?\"",

      "story": "San Francisco (initials SF) (, Spanish for Saint Francis; Spanish: ), officially the City and County of San Francisco, is the cultural, commercial, and financial center of Northern California. The consolidated city-county covers an area of about at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula in the San Francisco Bay Area. It is the fourth-most populous city in California, and the 13th-most populous in the United States, with a 2016 census-estimated population of 870,887. The population is projected to reach 1 million by 2033. \n\nSan Francisco was founded on June 29, 1776, when colonists from Spain established Presidio of San Francisco at the Golden Gate and Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds a few miles away, all named for St. Francis of Assisi. The California Gold Rush of 1849 brought rapid growth, making it the largest city on the West Coast at the time. San Francisco became a consolidated city-county in 1856. After three-quarters of the city was destroyed by the 1906 earthquake and fire, San Francisco was quickly rebuilt, hosting the Panama-Pacific International Exposition nine years later. In World War II, San Francisco was a major port of embarkation for service members shipping out to the Pacific Theater. It then became the birthplace of the United Nations in 1945. After the war, the confluence of returning servicemen, massive immigration, liberalizing attitudes, along with the rise of the \"hippie\" counterculture, the Sexual Revolution, the Peace Movement growing from opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War, and other factors led to the Summer of Love and the gay rights movement, cementing San Francisco as a center of liberal activism in the United States. Politically, the city votes strongly along liberal Democratic Party lines.",

The consolidated city-county covers an area of about at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula in the San Francisco Bay Area. It is the fourth-most populous city in California, and the 13th-most populous in the United States, with a 2016 census-estimated population of 870,887. The population is projected to reach 1 million by 2033. \n\nSan Francisco was founded on June 29, 1776, when colonists from Spain established Presidio of San Francisco at the Golden Gate and Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds a few miles away, all named for St. Francis of Assisi. The California Gold Rush of 1849 brought rapid growth, making it the largest city on the West Coast at the time. San Francisco became a consolidated city-county in 1856. After three-quarters of the city was destroyed by the 1906 earthquake and fire, San Francisco was quickly rebuilt, hosting the Panama-Pacific International Exposition nine years later. In World War II, San Francisco was a major port of embarkation for service members shipping out to the Pacific Theater. It then became the birthplace of the United Nations in 1945. After the war, the confluence of returning servicemen, massive immigration, liberalizing attitudes, along with the rise of the \"hippie\" counterculture, the Sexual Revolution, the Peace Movement growing from opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War, and other factors led to the Summer of Love and the gay rights movement, cementing San Francisco as a center of liberal activism in the United States. Politically, the city votes strongly along liberal Democratic Party lines.",

Suddenly, Snowball saw something interesting. \n\n\"Look at that!\" said Snowball. \n\n\"What is it?\" asked Fuzzy. \n\n\"It's a ball of yarn. On the top shelf!\" said Snowball. She had seen the yarn that was kept in a basket up there! \n\n\"That looks like it's fun to play with!\" said Fuzzy. \"But how could we get to it? It's so high up,\" he wondered. \n\n\"I have an idea,\" said Snowball. \"Watch this!\" Suddenly, Snowball jumped up on to the couch. \n\n\"What are you doing?\" asked Fuzzy. \n\n\"Just watch!\" said Snowball. Snowball then jumped to the table next to the couch. Then, she jumped to the middle shelf. \n\n\"That's dangerous!\" said Fuzzy. Snowball and Fuzzy were still small kittens. They weren't used to jumping very high yet. \n\n\"Don't worry, I'll be careful. I think we're allowed to be up here.\" said Snowball. Then, she jumped all the way to the top shelf, where the yarn was. \"Look out below!\" she yelled, and pushed the ball of yarn off the shelf and on to the floor. \n\n\"Whoa!\" said Fuzzy. \"Thanks!\" Snowball then jumped down to the middle shelf, and down to the table, and down to the couch, and back to the floor.

We can't do much, but we can make our little sacrifices, and ought to do it gladly. But I am afraid I don't,\" and Meg shook her head, as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted. \n\n\"But I don't think the little we should spend would do any good. We've each got a dollar, and the army wouldn't be much helped by our giving that. I agree not to expect anything from Mother or you, but I do want to buy _Undine and Sintran_ for myself. I've wanted it so long,\" said Jo, who was a bookworm. ",

      "story": "Hong Kong (CNN) -- The world watched, as the London 2012 Olympic Games opened with director Danny Boyle's elaborate ode to England, and furiously tapped their reaction on social media. \n\nBut one comment on Twitter has sparked a political fracas on the home soil of the games, as a British member of Parliament lamented the \"multi-cultural crap\" of the \u00a327 million ($42.4 million) ceremony. \n\nEntitled \"Isle of Wonder,\" Boyle -- the Oscar-winning director best known for hit movies \"Trainspotting\" and \"Slumdog Millionaire\" -- put together a star-studded on-field dramatization that drew on Shakespeare and Brit Pop to chart Britain from its pastoral roots through the Industrial Revolution to James Bond, Harry Potter and the Beatles. \n\n\"The most leftie opening ceremony I have ever seen -- more than Beijing, the capital of a communist state! Welfare tribute next?\" wrote Aidan Burley, a Conservative Party MP who was fired as a ministerial aide in David Cameron's government after revelations he attended a Nazi-themed stag party in France last year. \n\n\"Thank God the athletes have arrived! Now we can move on from leftie multi-cultural crap. Bring back red arrows, Shakespeare and the Stones!\" he added minutes later. \n\nBurley backpedaled after the strong online backlash against his comments, posting: \"Seems my tweet has been misunderstood. I was talking about the way it was handled in the show, not multiculturalism itself.\" \n\nQueen opens the London 2012 Olympics \n\nThere was a great deal of comparison being drawn between the London ceremony and the 2008 Beijing Olympics. @legallyblondekf wrote: \"Ha! London sees your zillion drummers drumming in unison and raises you a deaf drummer. Your move China,\" referring to deaf Scottish percussionist Evelyn Glennie leading drummers during the London ceremony. ",

The clone, a 10-week-old puppy dubbed Lancey, was hand-delivered to them earlier this week by Lou Hawthorne, chairman of BioArts International, a biotechnology company. \n\n\"One minute with Lancey and you know he's special. He's both extremely aware and very sweet,\" Hawthorne said in a BioArts statement. \n\nEdgar and Nina Otto said they began thinking about cloning Sir Lancelot about five years ago. \n\n\"I said 'Well, you know, it wouldn't hurt to have his DNA frozen,' and that's what we did,\" Nina Otto told CNN affiliate WPBF. \n\nThe Ottos were one of five families to bid and win a BioArts auction for a chance to clone their family dog, according to a BioArts statement. Lancey is the world's first commercially cloned dog, the company said; the Ottos are the first of six current clients to receive their clone. \n\nSir Lancelot's DNA sample was sent to the Sooam Biotech Research Foundation in Seoul, South Korea, which provides cloning services to BioArts. Researchers there put the DNA into an egg, and Lancey was born November 18, according to BioArts. \n\nThe Ottos said they have had many beloved dogs over the years -- and have nine others currently -- but maintain Sir Lancelot was special.

      "story": "Syncretism () is the combining of different beliefs, while blending practices of various schools of thought. Syncretism involves the merging or assimilation of several originally discrete traditions, especially in the theology and mythology of religion, thus asserting an underlying unity and allowing for an inclusive approach to other faiths. Syncretism also occurs commonly in expressions of arts and culture, (known as eclecticism) as well as politics (syncretic politics). \n\nThe English word is first attested in the early 17th century, from Modern Latin \"syncretismus\", drawing on Greek (\"synkretismos\"), meaning \"Cretan federation\". \n\nThe Greek word occurs in Plutarch's (1st century AD) essay on \"Fraternal Love\" in his \"Moralia\" (2.490b). He cites the example of the Cretans, who compromised and reconciled their differences and came together in alliance when faced with external dangers. \"And that is their so-called \"Syncretism\" [Union of Cretans]\". \n\nErasmus probably coined the modern usage of the Latin word in his \"Adagia\" (\"Adages\"), published in the winter of 1517\u20131518, to designate the coherence of dissenters in spite of their differences in theological opinions. In a letter to Melanchthon of April 22, 1519, Erasmus specifically adduced the Cretans of Plutarch as an example of his adage \"Concord is a mighty rampart\". \n\nOvert syncretism in folk belief may show cultural acceptance of an alien or previous tradition, but the \"other\" cult may survive or infiltrate without authorized \"syncresis\" nevertheless. For example, some Conversos developed a sort of cult for martyr-victims of the Spanish Inquisition, thus incorporating elements of Catholicism while resisting it.",

      "story": "(CNN) -- Tjaart van der Walt will seek to upstage two of his most illustrious golfing compatriots and win his first professional tournament at the Africa Open on Sunday. \n\nThe 37-year-old goes into the final round tied for the lead with 2010 British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen and one shot ahead of two-time U.S. Open winner Retief Goosen after carding a superb eight-under-par 65 in East London on Saturday. \n\nVan der Walt, who finished second in a 2005 U.S. PGA Tour event, eliminated Oosthuizen's two-shot overnight lead as he started with four successive birdies and -- like his fellow South African -- picked up a shot at the final hole. \n\nThe world No. 347's only blemish at his home event came at the par-four eighth hole, and he was confident he could contend for his first title since turning pro in 1996 in the opening event of the 2012 European Tour season. \n\n\"At the end of the day, the golf ball doesn't know that they are major champions,\" he said of his rivals. \"I've played at the highest level, I've never won majors or big events, so who knows what can happen. \n\n\"I do feel as if I am controlling the golf ball as well as I have in a long time. Not just tee to green, but on the greens as well. And that's a good sign for me. I'm entitled to forget the one bad shot I hit all day.\" \n\nDefending champion Oosthuizen's only lapse came at the par-five 11th hole as he took four shots to reach the green. ",

      "story": "IPA Braille is the modern standard Braille encoding of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), as recognized by the International Council on English Braille. \n\nA braille version of the IPA was first created by Merrick and Potthoff in 1934, and published in London. It was used in France, Germany, and anglophone countries. However, it was not updated as the IPA evolved, and by 1989 had become obsolete. In 1990 it was officially reissued by BAUK, but in a corrupted form that made it largely unworkable. In 1997 BANA created a completely new system for the United States and Canada. However, it was incompatible with braille IPA elsewhere in the world and in addition proved to be cumbersome and often inadequate. In 2008 Robert Englebretson revised the Merrick and Potthoff notation and by 2011 this had been accepted by BANA. It is largely true to the original in consonants and vowels, though the diacritics were completely reworked, as necessitated by the major revisions in print IPA diacritics since 1934. The diacritics were also made more systematic, and follow rather than precede the base letters. However, it has no general procedure for marking tone, and not all diacritics can be written. \n\nIPA Braille does not use the conventions of English Braille. It is set off by slash or square brackets, which indicate that the intervening material is IPA rather than national orthography. Thus brackets are required in braille even when not used in print.",

The Serie A managerial merry-go-round produced its usual raft of changes with over a third of clubs set to begin the season with a different coach from the previous campaign. \n\nCarlo Ancelotti's departure to Chelsea from AC Milan is the most high-profile change, with former Rossoneri hero Leonardo moving from his role as technical director at the club to take over as head coach. \n\nWalter Zenga's success in guiding unfancied Catania to a mid-table finish last season saw him make a controversial switch to bitter Sicilian rivals Palermo, with Gianluca Atzori replacing him at the Stadio Angelo Massimino. \n\nWho do you think will win the Italian Serie A title? Sound Off below. \n\nDelio Rossi parted company with Lazio, who appointed Davide Ballardini, while Luigi Del Neri left Atalanta to take over at Sampdoria with Angelo Gregucci taking the reins at the Bergamo club. \n\nElsewhere, promoted Bari dispensed with the services of Antonio Conte and handed the job to much-traveled Giampiero Ventura, while Livorno have brought in veteran Vittorio Russo to work alongside Gennaro Ruotolo as the latter does not hold the relevant coaching badges. \n\nOn the playing front, the major story was the transfer of Kaka from AC Milan to Real Madrid for $92 million, and the club spent part of that money on Klaas-Jan Huntelaar who arrived from the Spanish outfit for a fee in the region of $21m.

      "story": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- The new Italian Serie A season kicks off with the first round of fixtures this weekend -- Fanzone details what to expect from the forthcoming campaign: \n\nSo what's new? The Serie A managerial merry-go-round produced its usual raft of changes with over a third of clubs set to begin the season with a different coach from the previous campaign. \n\nCarlo Ancelotti's departure to Chelsea from AC Milan is the most high-profile change, with former Rossoneri hero Leonardo moving from his role as technical director at the club to take over as head coach. \n\nWalter Zenga's success in guiding unfancied Catania to a mid-table finish last season saw him make a controversial switch to bitter Sicilian rivals Palermo, with Gianluca Atzori replacing him at the Stadio Angelo Massimino. \n\nWho do you think will win the Italian Serie A title? Sound Off below. \n\nDelio Rossi parted company with Lazio, who appointed Davide Ballardini, while Luigi Del Neri left Atalanta to take over at Sampdoria with Angelo Gregucci taking the reins at the Bergamo club. \n\nElsewhere, promoted Bari dispensed with the services of Antonio Conte and handed the job to much-traveled Giampiero Ventura, while Livorno have brought in veteran Vittorio Russo to work alongside Gennaro Ruotolo as the latter does not hold the relevant coaching badges. \n\nOn the playing front, the major story was the transfer of Kaka from AC Milan to Real Madrid for $92 million, and the club spent part of that money on Klaas-Jan Huntelaar who arrived from the Spanish outfit for a fee in the region of $21m. CNN's Pedro Pinto previews the coming campaign. \u00bb ",

He did not detail how, when or where the rescue operation took place. \n\n\"A special operation of Cameroonian armed forces and security services of friendly countries\" freed the man, he said. \n\nEberhard told journalists he was glad to be alive. \n\n\"I am happy to see all these people around me, who have rescued me and made sure that I survived, because until the last minute, I did not know whether I would survive or I would not survive. It was for me a big problem. Because it was darkness, total darkness, and you see nobody around you. Then this is a big problem to say OK, I will survive or not survive,\" Eberhard said. \n\nEberhard was flown in from Cameroon's Far North Region to Yaounde shortly after noon Wednesday. \n\nHe said he was grateful to all those who worked to secure his release. \n\nThe German ambassador to Cameroon, Klaus-Ludwig Keferstein, also thanked Cameroonian authorities, particularly because \"we could find a solution to this problem of hostage-taking,\" he said. \n\nEberhard spoke amid heavy security and mentioned that he was teaching at a vocational school in Gombe, Adamawa state, Nigeria, before the insurgents took him hostage in July. \n\nHe has been taken to the residence of the German ambassador in Yaounde. The ambassador said initial medical care will be given to him before he is flown back to Germany for more medical attention. ",

Tom's wife Marge had died many years before, so he lived alone. He liked living alone, but he missed Rachel. Tom spent most of his time working in his garden. He liked to plant pumpkins, peppers, and tomatoes. He hated peas and broccoli, so he never planted them. He liked zucchini and spinach, but he didn't have any of those plants to plant. One day Tom got a call on his phone. He picked it up and asked who it was. The voice on the other end of the line said, \"It's me, Rachel.\" Tom was so surprised he almost dropped the phone. He said, \"Rachel, is it really you? I can't believe it.\" Rachel said that she had been thinking about Tom and she wanted to make up for their fight. Tom was so happy. They were going to meet the next weekend. Even before he hung up, Tom could imagine himself hugging his daughter. He sat down and thought about everything he wanted to say to her.",

She was nominated for the same honor in 1949 for \"Come to the Stable\" and 1950 for \"All about Eve,\" according to the Academy database. \n\nHolm's stage career began in 1936 in a Deer Lake, Pennsylvania, stock company, which led to an understudy role in a touring production of \"Hamlet\" with Leslie Howard, according to her official biography. \n\nHer Broadway debut in \"The Time of Your Life\" in 1939 was a small part, but it brought her to the attention of New York critics. Four years later, she was cast as Ado Annie in the smash \"Oklahoma!\" because of her ability to \"sing bad,\" the biography said. \n\nShe signed a long-term contract with 20th Century Fox that began her film career in 1945, after she toured Europe entertaining troops with the USO. Her first Fox movie was \"Three Little Girls in Blue\" in 1946, a supporting role that earned her star billing for the musical \"Carnival in Costa Rica\" in 1947. ",

And every afternoon when Alan, in the bed next to the window, could sit up, he would pass the time by describing to his roommate all the things he could see.

In less than five minutes, the coughing and choking stopped, along with the sound of breathing. Now, there was only silence ---- deathly silence. \n\nAs soon as it seemed appropriate, Henry asked if he could be moved next to the window. The nurse was happy to make the switch and after making sure he was comfortable, she left him alone. \n\nSlowly, painfully, he struggled to take his first look.

As he did his job, he would sometimes get wet from the rain, and every day he would have to rise before the sun did, but still Bob was very happy, and he was never sad or angry or scared. Watching the sun rise orange in the distance was always a fun way for Bob to start the day. Sometimes, Bob would even sing to keep the cattle calm.

      "story": "Johannesburg (CNN) -- A plane carrying Madagascar's ousted leader Marc Ravalomanana was turned away from Madagascan airspace Saturday as he tried to return from exile, his spokesman and the airline said. \n\nRavalomanana, who had been in South Africa in exile, took off from Johannesburg Saturday morning in what was his second bid to return to his home country. \n\nBut Ravalomanana's spokesman Patrick Gearing, in South Africa, told CNN that the civil aviation authorities on the Indian Ocean island had closed the airspace, refusing the plane permission to land. \n\nBy Saturday afternoon the plane -- and Ravalomanana -- were back in South Africa, said Gearing. \n\nRavalomanana was ousted in March 2009 through a coup backed by the military, which handed power to current President Andry Rajoelina, the youthful former mayor of Antananarivo. \n\nShortly before boarding his flight to the capital, Antananarivo, Ravalomanana said that he had just spoken with the Madagascan Prime Minister Omer Beriziky, who told him \"everything was OK.\" \n\nSpeaking before the flight took off, Gearing said: \"He has no control over what will happen to him when he arrives but he is prepared to face whatever comes his way.\" \n\nRavalomanana's previous unsuccessful effort to return last year came to an end in Johannesburg, when the airline he was using was told it wouldn't be allowed to land if he was on board. \n\nMadagascar is in the process of implementing a peace agreement facilitated by a regional body, the South African Development Community. \n\nGearing says Ravalomanana met with South Africa's President Jacob Zuma Friday to thank him for letting him stay following his ouster.

During the birth of her younger son, Farrow began bleeding badly. Dr. Paris managed to solve the problem in a delicate procedure. \"Twenty years ago, she probably would have died,\" he says. Today, when he performs school sports physical examinations for the Farrow boys, 10 and 11, he is always reminded that lives are changed forever by doctors just doing their jobs. \n\nTo be a mix of country doc and somewhat adventurer, the 55-year-old family physician moved to Hailey after completing his residency . He hoped to practice medicine there and ski at nearby Sun Valley. Unfortunately, the only job opening was for an emergency-room doctor in Missoula, Montana, 300 miles away. Dr. Paris took it. \"I'd ski all day and then drive all night to be in Missoula for a 48-hour shift,\" he recalls. \"I'm lucky to be alive.\" Knowing he couldn't keep up with his eight-hour commute , he began taking flying lessons. \n\nIn 1981, Dr. Paris joined a small medical practice in Hailey, a former mining town with a population at the time of 2,109. As Hailey grew in the shadow of Sun Valley's booming popularity, Dr. Paris's own practice expanded to seven physicians, including his wife, Kathryn Woods, who is also a family doctor. They met in 1986 at a certification exam in Denver when, in a room full of men in stodgy suits, Woods arrived wearing a Lycra biking outfit and carrying the front wheel of her bicycle (which she couldn't lock up outside). Dr. Paris asked her out on the spot. In 1989, they married.",

By mid-day, trains laden with coal were rushing to several of the Channel ports. Maraton found his task with the miners more difficult, and yet in a way his triumph here was still more complete. He travelled down the backbone of England, preaching peace where war had reigned, promising great things in the name of the new Government. Although he had been absent barely forty-eight hours, it was a new London into which he travelled on his return. The streets were crowded once more with taxicabs, the evening papers were being sold, the shops were all open, the policemen were once more in the streets. Selingman, who had scarcely once left Maraton's side, gazed about him with wonder. \n\n\"It is a miracle, this,\" he declared. \"There is no aftermath.\" \n\n\"The people are waiting,\" Maraton said. \"We have given them serious pledges. Their day is to come.\" \n\n\"You believe that Foley will keep his word?\" Selingman asked. \n\n\"I know that he will,\" Maraton replied. \"As soon as the Bills are drafted, he will go to the country. It will be a new Party--the National Party. Stay and see it, Selingman--a new era in the politics of the world, a very wonderful era. The country is going to be governed for the people that are worth while.\" ",

      "story": "Simply by analyzing a drop of blood, a doctor will be able to diagnose a birth defect or even cancer when it is in the early stage; using new technology, a material lighter but much stronger than steel can be produced. \n\nThese may sound like dreams at present. But the dreams may soon come true as research findings in laboratories are being turned into products more rapidly in the new century, according to experts participating in the fourth Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Technomart, a technology exhibition and trade fair in Suzhou. \n\n\"Most people think nano-technology is too far-fetched to be real. But in fact nano-technology has been applied in a wide range of fields, such as medicine. It is coming into our daily life,\" said Cheng Jiachong from a Hong Kong-based nano-technology firm. \n\nNano-technology based on the nanometer, the unit of which is a billionth of a meter, enables scientists to have new concepts of disease diagnosis and treatment on a molecular and atomic scale, Cheng said. \n\nBy using nanometer particles, a doctor can separate the fetus cells from the blood of a pregnant woman to see if the development of the fetus is normal. This method is also being used in the early diagnosis of cancer and heart disease, he said. \n\nOne of the most significant impacts of nano-technology is at the bio-inorganic materials interface, according to Greg Tegart, executive advisor of the APEC Center for Technology Foresight. \n\n\"By combining enzymes and silicon chips we can produce biosensors. These could be implanted in humans or animals to monitor health and to deliver corrective doses of drugs,\" he told the participants a technology forum during the exhibition. \n\n\"Nano-technology could affect the production of nearly every man-made object, from automobiles, tires and computer circuits , to advanced medicines and tissue replacement, and lead to the invention of objects yet to be imagined,\" said David Minns, a special advisor to the National Research Council of Canada. \n\nIt has been shown that carbon nano-tubes are ten times as strong as steel, with one sixth of the weight, and nano-scale systems have the potential to make supersonic transport cost- effective and to increase computer efficiency by millions of times, he said. \n\nThe experts agreed that the APEC technology exhibition and trade fair provided many chances for exchanges of innovative ideas and products.",

S. Air Force but he failed because of his poor eyesight. However, his dream remained. At the age of 33, Ted was a truck driver in Los Angeles. One day, while sitting outside in his garden, he watched planes fly overhead and an idea came to him: to use balloons to fly. A few weeks later, Ted bought 42 huge balloons. He tied them to a chair and then he sat down in the chair with some beer, sandwiches and a gun. His plan was to fly to 10 meters above his garden, enjoy a few hours in the air, and then shoot some balloons with his gun to get back down. But things did not go as he planned. Once his friends cut the ropes under Ted's chair, the 42 balloons flew into the sky at an astonishing speed until about 4000 meters above the ground with Ted and his chair. He didn't shoot any of the balloons because he was afraid he might break the balanee of his \"plane\". Ted stayed in the sky with his beer and sandwiches for 14 hours, cold and frightened. Planes heading towards Los Angeles' busy international airport reported the strange sight. And Ted' s balloons caused great danger to them. At last, Ted gathered his courage to shoot a few balloons and slowly landed on the ground, where many policemen were waiting for him. Ted made his dream come true, but it cost him: he was fined $ 1,500 for breaking the law about air safety. When asked by a reporter why he had done it, Ted answered, \"A man can't just sit around and do nothing; he should have his dream and go for it. \"",

Don't you like it up here on your kite?\" \"No, we don't!\" said Ricky. \"What's a kite?\" said Carmen. \n\nGeorge told them they were on a kite. He showed them the string. He said, \"You can follow that string all the way to the ground.\" It looked like a long way down. But they thanked George for his help and slowly crawled down the string to the ground. They were safe.",

Day after day, Puddles would have to eat cat food and do cat things in order to fit in with the rest of his group. He found it very boring and Puddles was sad. Puddles didn't even look like a cat! \n\nAll of the other cats teased Puddles. \"You're too big,\" they said. \"You've got too long of a nose!\" \"Why are you panting like that?\" Puddles knew that he was different. \n\nOne day, Puddles chose to run away from all of the cats. The cats laughed at him. What a stupid dog! Didn't he know that there were monsters in the woods that could eat him? Puddles didn't care, because Puddles was sad enough to try. \n\nSo Puddles packed up his things - his squeaky ball, his water dish, and his bone - and headed off into the woods. He was finally happy! All of a sudden, Puddles turned. He smelled a funny smell. It smelled like something he had never smelled before. He turned around, and what did he see but another dog! \n\nPuddles was so happy, he barked with joy. He went home with the other dog, who was named Mittens, and to his family.

The Duke had especially asked both Mrs. Finn and Lady Mabel to remain, the former, through his anxiety to show his repentance for the injustice he had formerly done her, and the latter in the hope that something might be settled as soon as the crowd of visitors should have gone. He had never spoken quite distinctly to Mabel. He had felt that the manner in which he had learned his son's purpose,--that which once had been his son's purpose,--forbade him to do so. But he had so spoken as to make Lady Mabel quite aware of his wish. He would not have told her how sure he was that Silverbridge would keep no more racehorses, how he trusted that Silverbridge had done with betting, how he believed that the young member would take a real interest in the House of Commons, had he not intended that she should take a special interest in the young man. And then he had spoken about the house in London. It was to be made over to Silverbridge as soon as Silverbridge should marry. And there was Gatherum Castle. Gatherum was rather a trouble than otherwise. He had ever felt it to be so, but had nevertheless always kept it open perhaps for a month in the year. His uncle had always resided there for a fortnight at Christmas. When Silverbridge was married it would become the young man's duty to do something of the same kind. Gatherum was the White Elephant of the family, and Silverbridge must enter in upon his share of the trouble. He did not know that in saying all this he was offering his son as a husband to Lady Mabel, but she understood it as thoroughly as though he had spoken the words. ",

Her co-star, Dustin Hoffman, said, \"She's extraordinarily hardworking. I think she thinks about nothing else but what she's doing.\" Meryl won her first Oscar for her performance in this film. \n\nSophie's Choice (1982) \n\nMeryl plays Sophie, a Polish war survivor. To prepare for the role she learned to speak German and perfected a Polish accent. Film critic Roger Ebert said, \"This is one of the most astonishing and yet one of the most natural performances I can imagine.\" Meryl won her second Best Actress Oscar for her performance. \n\nOut of Africa(1985) \n\nMeryl is Karen Blixen, a Danish woman living in Kenya in the early 20th century. The story follows Karens attempts to run a coffee plantation and her love affair with big-game hunter Denys. The film is based on the memoirs of the real Karen Blixen. \n\nA Cry in the Dark (1995) \n\nThis is based on the true-life case of the disappearance of baby Azaria. Meryl plays Linda Chamberlain, a mother who is wrongly accused of killing her own child. After spending four years in prison, it was found that wild dogs had taken away the baby. Meryl won Best Actress at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival. \n\nThe Bridge of Madison County (1995) \n\nThis movie is based on one of the biggest bestsellers of the 20th century (the book sold 50 million copies worldwide). Meryl plays Francesca Johnson, an Italian war bride living in 1960s Iowa. It's about her brief affair with photographer Robert Kincaid. \n\nMamma Mial(2008) \n\nThis is a romantic comedy based on the stage musical Mamma Mial, featuring the music from 1970s Swedish pop group ABBA. Meryl plays Donna Sheridan, a hotel owner on the Greek island of Kalokairi. Mamma Mial made over U.S. $ 600 million worldwide. Apparently, Meryl had seen the musical in 2001 and was completely absorbed in it. She had no idea that seven years later she'd be in the movie version.",

      "story": "When your pet meets your infant, it might not be love at first sniff. \n\nBaby's Best Friend \n\nWhen Jennifer Merritt brought her baby, Arielle, home from the hospital, her cherished dogs had very different reactions. Her boxer, Sonya, was immediately gentle and protective. But Tiger, the Pomeranian, was less welcoming: \"If any diapers or toys were on the floor, he peed on them!\"says the Greenbrier, prefix = st1 /Arkansas, mom. Tiger isn't the first dog to feel jealous of a baby. In the eyes of a pet's, there's a new star in town who's stealing his spotlight. Even the most gentle animal will probably act up if he doesn't get his usual attention. These simple steps will help your pet adjust -- and keep your baby safe. \n\nu Introduce Them with Care \n\nYour newborn and pet's first encounter can set the tone for their relationship. To make it as smooth as possible, try this trick from Caryn Ruiz, of Raleigh, North Carolina: \"Before we left the hospital, my husband took blankets home to our dog, Daisy, so she'd know our newborn Devon's smell.\" When you get home, have your husband carry the baby so you can greet your pet without worrying about her jumping on you. A cat will likely walk away at first, while a dog will probably want to investigate right away. \n\nTo introduce your baby, get down on your pet's level and let her have a hello sniff. Don't panic and pull your newborn away unless your pet is barking or hissing, because it'll send the message that the baby is a threat. \n\nu Learn the Safety Basics \n\nNo matter how smoothly the introduction goes, there are certain safety rules you should follow, says Bonnie Beaver, DVM, past president of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Number one: Never leave your baby alone with the pet. Even the gentlest animal can react unpredictably. Your baby's crying could frighten your cat, or your dog could suddenly become territorial. Consider setting up baby gates to limit your pet's access. To keep your cat from jumping into the bassinet , try putting mosquito netting over the top. Cats hate sticky paws, so keep the crib and changing table off-limits by lining the edges with sticky strips made for furniture (available in most pet stores). You can also train your dog to sleep in a crate.",

      "story": "Affirmative action in the United States tends to focus on issues such as education and employment, specifically granting special consideration to racial minorities, Native Americans, and women who have been historically excluded groups in America. Reports have shown that minorities and women have faced discrimination in schools and businesses for many years and this discrimination produced unfair advantages for whites and males in education and employment. The impetus toward affirmative action is redressing the disadvantages associated with past and present discrimination. Further impetus is a desire to ensure public institutions, such as universities, hospitals, and police forces, are more representative of the populations they serve. \n\nAffirmative action is a subject of controversy. Some policies adopted as affirmative action, such as racial quotas or gender quotas for collegiate admission, have been criticized as a form of reverse discrimination, and such implementation of affirmative action has been ruled unconstitutional by the majority opinion of Gratz v. Bollinger. Affirmative action as a practice was upheld by the Supreme Court's decision in Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003. Affirmative action policies were developed in order to correct decades of discrimination stemming from the Reconstruction Era by granting disadvantaged minorities opportunities. Many believe that the diversity of current American society suggests that affirmative action policies succeeded and are no longer required. Opponents of affirmative action argue that these policies are outdated and lead to reverse discrimination which entails favoring one group over another based upon racial preference rather than achievement.",

He knows from experience what it means, as the Portuguese film director has reached the age of 102 and is still active in his profession. Every year, Oliveira shoots a film and is currently working on his next project. \"You have to work, work, work in order to forget that death is not far away,\" he said. When asked about his age, Oliveira said with some humility: \"It's down to mother nature. It gave to me what it took from others.\" \n\nBeing both mentally and physically fit in old age is partly a matter of luck, but it also has something to do with character. Not every white-haired person is wise and social skills, openness and the ability to train the brain are essential for senior citizens. \n\nAlong with the architect Oscar Niemeyer (103), Nobel laureate Montalcini (101) and director Kurt Maetzig (100), Oliveira is one of those people of whom it would be very wrong to think as members of a listless elderly generation. \n\nAnother master in his profession is the architect Oscar Niemeyer. The 103-year-old Brazilian is best known for his futuristic-looking buildings in Brasilia, but he also speaks out on behalf of the poor. \"The role of the architect is to struggle for a better world where we can develop a form of architecture that serves everyone and not just a privileged few,\" said Niemeyer recently. He spends almost every day working in his office in Copacabana, and even when he falls ill he keeps working on ideas: After a gallbladder operation he composed a samba tune in the clinic. \n\nAnother man who could sing a song about age is 107-year-old Heesters. The Dutch-born opera singer spent most of his life performing in Germany, where he still works. Recently Heesters said: \"I want to be at least 108-years-old.\" He also plans to keep performing. \" _ \" Heesters has not given up trying to add to his tally of awards and is looking for a \"good stage role\". \n\nItalian scientist Rita Levi-Montalcini, who is 101-year-old and is still active in medical science, has described the force that keeps driving her on: \"Progress is created through imperfection.\" In 1986 she and her lab colleague were awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their work on nerve growth factor. She's convinced that humans grow on challenges. \n\nWith so many brilliant examples given, we can see clearly that age is no barrier to some high achievers.",

      "story": "Famous centenarians still active in arts, science are in no mood to retire. \"Those who stand still, die,\" is one of Oliveira's favorite phrases. He knows from experience what it means, as the Portuguese film director has reached the age of 102 and is still active in his profession. Every year, Oliveira shoots a film and is currently working on his next project. \"You have to work, work, work in order to forget that death is not far away,\" he said. When asked about his age, Oliveira said with some humility: \"It's down to mother nature. It gave to me what it took from others.\" \n\nBeing both mentally and physically fit in old age is partly a matter of luck, but it also has something to do with character. Not every white-haired person is wise and social skills, openness and the ability to train the brain are essential for senior citizens. \n\nAlong with the architect Oscar Niemeyer (103), Nobel laureate Montalcini (101) and director Kurt Maetzig (100), Oliveira is one of those people of whom it would be very wrong to think as members of a listless elderly generation. \n\nAnother master in his profession is the architect Oscar Niemeyer. The 103-year-old Brazilian is best known for his futuristic-looking buildings in Brasilia, but he also speaks out on behalf of the poor. \"The role of the architect is to struggle for a better world where we can develop a form of architecture that serves everyone and not just a privileged few,\" said Niemeyer recently. He spends almost every day working in his office in Copacabana, and even when he falls ill he keeps working on ideas: After a gallbladder operation he composed a samba tune in the clinic. \n\nAnother man who could sing a song about age is 107-year-old Heesters. The Dutch-born opera singer spent most of his life performing in Germany, where he still works. Recently Heesters said: \"I want to be at least 108-years-old.\" He also plans to keep performing. \" _ \" Heesters has not given up trying to add to his tally of awards and is looking for a \"good stage role\". \n\nItalian scientist Rita Levi-Montalcini, who is 101-year-old and is still active in medical science, has described the force that keeps driving her on: \"Progress is created through imperfection.\" In 1986 she and her lab colleague were awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their work on nerve growth factor. She's convinced that humans grow on challenges. \n\nWith so many brilliant examples given, we can see clearly that age is no barrier to some high achievers.",

Keen as he was on hunting, he would not have been sorry to head for home, for his duck trousers were badly torn and one of his boots which had been rather the worse for wear when he started was almost dropping off his foot. They trudged on, however, and accident favored them, as it often does when one is hunting, for at last when they were in very thick bush Harry dropped suddenly behind a patch of withered fern. \n\n\"Look there!\" he said softly. \"Right ahead of you yonder.\" \n\nFrank gazed ahead with straining eyes, but he could only see the great trunks stretching back in serried ranks. He had heard somewhat to his astonishment that it is not often that a novice can see a deer in the bush even when it is pointed out to him, but now, it seemed, the thing was true. He could have declared that there was not a deer anywhere within the range of his vision. \n\n\"Right in front,\" whispered Harry, impatiently. \"About seventy yards off. Oh, look yonder!\" ",

In English Mars carries a name of the Roman god of war, and is often referred to as the \"Red Planet\" because the reddish iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. \n\nThe rotational period and seasonal cycles of Mars are likewise similar to those of Earth, as is the tilt that produces the seasons. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and second-highest known mountain in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped.

Thus, early on Monday, a party of about thirty set forth on horseback, including the Ribaumonts, Rayonette being perched by turns in front of her father or mother, and the Duke de Quinet declaring that he should do his best to divide the journey into stages not too long for Philip, since he was anxious to give his mother plenty of time to make preparations for her royal guest. \n\nHe had, however, little reckoned on the young King's promptitude. The first courier he had dispatched was overtaken at a _cabaret_ only five leagues from Pont de Dronne, baiting his horse, as he said; the second was found on the road with a lame horse; and the halt a day's journey remained beyond it. The last stage had been ridden, much to the Duke's discontent, for it brought them to a mere village inn, with scarcely any accommodation. The only tolerable bed was resigned by the King to the use of Philip, whose looks spoke the exhaustion of which his tongue scorned to complain. So painful and feverish a night ensued that Eustacie was anxious that he should not move until the Duke should, as he promised, send a mule litter back for him; but this proposal he resented; and in the height of his constitutional obstinacy, appeared booted and spurred at the first signal to mount.

He found Mrs. Vivian and her daughter, very opportunely, in the garden of the pleasant, homely Schloss which forms the residence of the Grand Dukes of Baden during their visits to the scene of our narrative, and which, perched upon the hill-side directly above the little town, is surrounded with charming old shrubberies and terraces. To this garden a portion of the public is admitted, and Bernard, who liked the place, had been there more than once. One of the terraces had a high parapet, against which Angela was leaning, looking across the valley. Mrs. Vivian was not at first in sight, but Bernard presently perceived her seated under a tree with Victor Cousin in her hand. As Bernard approached the young girl, Angela, who had not seen him, turned round. \n\n\"Don't move,\" he said. \"You were just in the position in which I painted your portrait at Siena.\" \n\n\"Don't speak of that,\" she answered. \n\n\"I have never understood,\" said Bernard, \"why you insist upon ignoring that charming incident.\" \n\nShe resumed for a moment her former position, and stood looking at the opposite hills. \n\n\"That 's just how you were--in profile--with your head a little thrown back.\" \n\n\"It was an odious incident!\" Angela exclaimed, rapidly changing her attitude. \n\nBernard was on the point of making a rejoinder, but he thought of Gordon Wright and held his tongue.

When used as an ecclesiastical styling or title, the term may be abbreviated to \"Pr\" or \"Ptr\" (singular) or \"Ps\" (plural). A pastor also gives advice and counsel to people from the community or congregation. It is derrived from the Latin word, \"pascere\", meaning fed or grazed. \n\nThe word \"pastor\" derives from the Latin noun which means \"shepherd\" and relates to the Latin verb - \"to lead to pasture, set to grazing, cause to eat\". The term \"pastor\" also relates to the role of elder within the New Testament, but is not synonymous with the biblical understanding of minister. Many Protestant churches call their ministers \"pastors\". \n\nPresent-day usage of the word is rooted in the Biblical image of shepherding. The Hebrew Bible (or Old Testament) uses the Hebrew word (\"ra\u02bfah\") which means shepherd. It occurs 173 times and relates to the feeding of sheep, as in Genesis 29:7, or to the spiritual feeding of human beings, as in Jeremiah 3:15, \"Then I will give you shepherds after My own heart, who will feed you on knowledge and understanding\" (NASB). English-language translations of the New Testament usually render the Greek noun (\"poim\u0113n\") as \"shepherd\" and the Greek verb (\"poimaino\") as \"to shepherd\". The two words occur a total of 29 times in the New Testament, most frequently referring to Jesus. For example, Jesus called himself the \"Good Shepherd\" in John 10:11. The same words in the familiar Christmas story (Luke 2) refer to literal shepherds.",

The bus driver said \"good to see you Bob\". Bob said \"you too Mr. Smith\". Bob was so excited to see his friends that he could barely breathe. As he walked down the school bus, Bob's friends Jill, Jim, Jeff and Chris all waved to him. Instead of sitting next to his best friend Chris, Bob turned left and sat next to Jill. Jeff and Jim started laughing at him and teased \"Bob and Jill sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G\". Bob's face turned red from embarrassment. Chris felt bad for Bob and reached into his pockets to help his friend. When he reached in, he felt a pencil, a rock and a folded up piece of paper. Chris's eyes twinkled. He had a plan. Without Jim and Jeff seeing, Chris quickly made a paper airplane with the piece of paper he found in his pocket. He threw the paper airplane at Jim. The plane hit Jim in the face. Both Jim and Jeff stopped laughing. Bob looked over to Chris and smiled.",

Luke Ravenstahl, cashing in on his family's political tradition, is already the mayor of Pittsburgh, the youngest mayor of any major city in the country. Although mayors elsewhere have been younger, Jeff Dunkel was 18 in 2001 when he was elected mayor of Mount Carbon, small towns inNew York, and elsewhere have also elected teenagers as mayors. But,Tallahassee, is the only other city with a population over 100,000 that has had a mayor as young as Mr. Ravenstahl. A supporter of Mr. Ravenstahl said concerns about Mr. Ravenstahl's age would _ once the city saw his work ethic. But now comes the hard part. As he strives to be taken seriously and take charge of a city only recently back from the brink of bankruptcy, the baby-faced mayor said that even the smallest decisions felt weighty, even what to wear in the Steelers game matters. And another pressing issue is to strengthen the city's economy. Pittsburghhas lost all its mills, nearly half its population and much of its downtown commercial district in the last several decades. \"ButPittsburghhas 50,000 college students, and our challenge is to figure out how to retain them and to increase downtown development.\" He said. But one of the biggest uncertainties is how long he will remain in office. According to the city charter, Mayor Ravenstahl's term will not expire until November 2009. Some city lawyers, however, have argued that he must face the electorate next year. And residents in Pittsburghare still withholding judgment on him. Deli, Jimmy Cvetic, a sandwich shop owner, said \"I call him Cool Hand Luke. He'll be all right, but he's going to need a cool hand to get through this.\" Mayor Ravenstahl said he was still coming to terms with the challenge he faced.",

When Winston came in he looked up from the bed where he lay, with the dust still white upon his clothing, and his face showed gray and haggard in the creeping light. \n\n\"I'm feeling a trifle better now,\" he said; \"still, I scarcely fancy I could get up just yet.

Of course, I knew how much your promise was worth, but in view of the risks you ran, I had not expected you to turn up at the Grange.\" \n\n\"The risks!\" said Courthorne, with an unpleasant smile. \n\n\"Yes,\" said Winston wearily, \"I have a good deal on hand I would like to finish here and it will not take me long, but I am quite prepared to give myself up now, if it is necessary.\" \n\nCourthorne laughed. \"I don't think you need, and it wouldn't be wise. You see, even if you made out your innocence, which you couldn't do, you rendered yourself an accessory by not denouncing me long ago.

In 1998, there were 400,325 Namibian students in primary school and 115,237 students in secondary schools. The pupil-teacher ratio in 1999 was estimated at 32:1, with about 8% of the GDP being spent on education. Curriculum development, educational research, and professional development of teachers is centrally organised by the National Institute for Educational Development (NIED) in Okahandja. \n\nNamibia (i/n\u0259\u02c8m\u026abi\u0259/, /n\u00e6\u02c8-/), officially the Republic of Namibia (German: Republik Namibia (help\u00b7info); Afrikaans: Republiek van Namibi\u00eb) is a country in southern Africa whose western border is the Atlantic Ocean. It shares land borders with Zambia and Angola to the north, Botswana to the east and South Africa to the south and east. Although it does not border Zimbabwe, a part of less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River (essentially a small bulge in Botswana to achieve a Botswana/Zambia micro-border) separates it from that country. Namibia gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the Namibian War of Independence. Its capital and largest city is Windhoek, and it is a member state of the United Nations (UN), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Union (AU), and the Commonwealth of Nations.",

Benmehidi said his country granted entrance to Gadhafi's wife, Safia, his daughter, Aisha, sons Hannibal and Mohamed and their children on \"humanitarian grounds.\" \n\n\"We made sure the international community has been informed,\" said Benmehidi. \n\nThe ambassador said he did not know whether Moammar Gadhafi was expected to seek entry into Algeria and claimed none of the Gadhafis were subject to U.N. Security Council sanctions. \n\nIn fact, U.N. Security Council Resolution 1970, passed on February 26, includes the names of all three Gadhafi children who are now in Algeria as being subject to a \"travel ban\" because of their \"closeness of association with (the) regime.\" \n\nThe U.N. ban requires \"all member states\" to prevent them and others listed from entering their territories, unless there is some special circumstance that the council agrees warrants an exception. The resolution also allows the nation -- in this case, Algeria -- to determine \"on a case-by-case basis that such entry or transit is required to advance peace and stability (and) notifies the committee within 48 hours after making such a determination.\" \n\nNews on Monday of the Gadhafi relatives' departure from Libya came the same day that a senior rebel commander reported that Khamis Gadhafi, a son of the Libyan leader and military commander in his regime, had been killed Sunday night.

      "story": "Fran\u00e7ois-Marie Arouet (; 21 November 1694 \u2013 30 May 1778), known by his \"nom de plume\" Voltaire, was a French Enlightenment writer, historian, and philosopher famous for his wit, his attacks on the established Catholic Church, and his advocacy of freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and separation of church and state. \n\nVoltaire was a versatile and prolific writer, producing works in almost every literary form, including plays, poems, novels, essays, and historical and scientific works. He wrote more than 20,000 letters and more than 2,000 books and pamphlets.

She is best known for being on \"Britain's Got Talent\"(<<>> )when she was just six. She has been singing since she was 19 months old. The song she is most known for is Somewhere over the Rainbow. And now she is touring the country with the UK's biggest children's choir--Young Voices. Do you know what the Young Voices Tour is? Well, it's a great event for children. It is great for them to sing on a big stage with thousands of other children. Everyone waits for the parents to arrive in the evening to watch the children put on a great show. There is so much fun. When the lights turn on, everyone sings together at the same time as one. It's so loud and powerful . Connie loves looking around at the choir and seeing everyone so happy when she was performing. \"We've heard you got a new Guinness world record!\" I asked her. \"Yes! I am very proud. It was amazing to get the Guinness world record for the biggest choir at the back of a singer. I am glad to share that world record with more than 6000 other children present that day,\" she answered.",

      "story": "Jockeys are the smallest athletes. They are rarely over five feet six, or 120 pounds. The lighter the weight on the horse, the faster it can go. \n\nRiding fast horses on the track is tough on the small jockeys. The jockey doesn't\"sit\"on the horse. He leans forward on his legs. The strain is on his thighs and calf muscles. As jockeys age, their legs\"go\"first. Jockeys also need arm strength. It's a strain holding a 1000-pound racehorse. \n\nOn muddy days, jockeys get a pounding of mud. The mud comes flying off the hooves of the horses in front. \"It feels like someone is punching you all over,\"says one rider. \n\nAnd a jockey can be hurt. A jockey can have a leg jammed between two horses. Or it can get caught between horse and the rail. The worst accidents are from falls. A horse may fall on his rider. Or horses behind may trample if he hits the track. In one year about 240 riders are hurt badly. That's one out of six jockeys. \n\nBut the jockeys are well-paid. A jockey keeps about ten percent of the money his horses win. Jacinto Vasquez, a five-foot-three comer, has ridden horses to $7,000,000 in wins in the last eight years, which means he does almost $100,000 a year. \n\nWhy do some jockeys do better than others? \"It isn't the way a boy sits on a horse or uses the reins or the whip,\"says Conn McCreary. McCreary was a top jockey of the 1950's. He rode two Kentucky Derby winners. \"Most jockeys do this the same. It's the 'feel' he has for the horses.\" \n\n\"When you come right down to it, it just seems that horses run better for some riders,\" McCreary says. \"A real good jockey doesn't lose with the best horse. And sometimes he'll win with the second or third best.\" \n\nMany Latin-American riders, like Jacinto, seem to have the _ . \"Maybe it's because we grew up with horses,\"says Jacinto. \"Maybe it's because we like to ride. There was a strike at Aqueduct last year. We, Jorge Velasquez, and Angel Cordero (two other top Latin riders) went to a park. We rented horses, and rode around the bridle path !\"",

      "story": "Kurdish is a continuum of Northwestern Iranian languages spoken by the Kurds in Western Asia. Kurdish forms three dialect groups known as Northern Kurdish (Kurmanji), Central Kurdish (Sorani), and Southern Kurdish (Palewani). A separate group of non-Kurdish Northwestern Iranian languages, the Zaza\u2013Gorani languages, are also spoken by several million Kurds. Studies as of 2009 estimate between 8 and 20 million native Kurdish speakers in Turkey. The majority of the Kurds speak Northern Kurdish (\"Kurmanji\"). \n\nThe literary output in Kurdish was mostly confined to poetry until the early 20th century, when more general literature began to be developed. Today, there are two principal written Kurdish dialects, namely Northern Kurdish in the northern parts of the geographical region of Kurdistan and Central Kurdish further east and south. Central Kurdish is, along with Arabic, one of the two official languages of Iraq and is in political documents simply referred to as \"Kurdish\". \n\nThe Kurdish languages belong to the Iranian branch of the Indo-European family. They are generally classified as Northwestern Iranian languages, or by some scholars as intermediate between Northwestern and Southwestern Iranian. Martin van Bruinessen notes that \"Kurdish has a strong south-western Iranian element\", whereas \"Zaza and Gurani [...] do belong to the north-west Iranian group\".",

A considerable detachment had come into the courtyard to speed him on his way; and now they were walking back, round the side of the house, towards the terrace and the garden. They walked in silence; nobody had yet ventured to comment on the departed guest. \n\n\"Well?\" said Anne at last, turning with raised inquiring eyebrows to Denis. \n\n\"Well?\" It was time for someone to begin. \n\nDenis declined the invitation; he passed it on to Mr Scogan. \"Well?\" he said. \n\nMr. Scogan did not respond; he only repeated the question, \"Well?\" \n\nIt was left for Henry Wimbush to make a pronouncement. \"A very agreeable adjunct to the week-end,\" he said. His tone was obituary. \n\nThey had descended, without paying much attention where they were going, the steep yew-walk that went down, under the flank of the terrace, to the pool. The house towered above them, immensely tall, with the whole height of the built-up terrace added to its own seventy feet of brick facade. The perpendicular lines of the three towers soared up, uninterrupted, enhancing the impression of height until it became overwhelming. They paused at the edge of the pool to look back. \n\n\"The man who built this house knew his business,\" said Denis. \"He was an architect.\" \n\n\"Was he?\" said Henry Wimbush reflectively. \"I doubt it. The builder of this house was Sir Ferdinando Lapith, who flourished during the reign of Elizabeth. He inherited the estate from his father, to whom it had been granted at the time of the dissolution of the monasteries; for Crome was originally a cloister of monks and this swimming-pool their fish-pond. Sir Ferdinando was not content merely to adapt the old monastic buildings to his own purposes; but using them as a stone quarry for his barns and byres and outhouses, he built for himself a grand new house of brick--the house you see now.\" ",

      "story": "Face-book chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and Anna Maria Chavez, chief of American Girl Scouts, are leading a campaign to discourage the use of the word \"bossy\". Does the term destroy the confidence of young girls? \n\nThe campaign claims that terms like \"bossy\" are improperly applied to females, preventing schoolgirls from seeing themselves as future \"leaders\". From its first application, the word has been definitely connected more with women than with men. It first appeared in 1882, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, mentioning \"a lady manager who was extremely bossy\". As late as 2008, the word appeared in reference to females four times more often than males, claim the Ban Bossy campaigners. \"To me, the reference is always is association with women,\" says Helen Trim, director of Fresh Minds. \"I have three brothers and my family still call me 'bossy' today.\" Her father is the only other family member who could be considered in that way, says Trim, but nobody would ever call him so. \n\nSome educators recommend that the word should be reclaimed, rather than banned.\"But the thing with'bossy' is that there's an infantile element to it,\"says Sara Mills, professor at Sheffield University. \"You think of 'bossy' as being like a little kid who's claiming more than he has the right to claim.\" \n\nIt's not just\"bossy\"under fire.\"Pushy\"is another target. The implication is that women shouldn't present themselves as powerful and confident. Mills suggests, which some women are willing to listen to and accept. Trim points out that many modern female business role models are able to be bosses without being labeled'bossy'.And she rarely,if ever, hears the word used within her company. But she says that the damage may be dome much earlier in a woman's life.\"It does come about from those early teenage years.\"she says.\"I think it's impossible to ban a word, but if people are replacing it with words like'confidence'or'assertiveness',we would all be in a much better place.\"",

He thought that (faking having the weapons) would prevent the Iranians from reinvading Iraq,\" said Piro. \n\nDuring the nearly seven months Piro talked to Hussein, the agent hinted to the Iraqi that he answered directly to President Bush, CBS said in a posting on its Web site. \n\n\"He told me he initially miscalculated ... President Bush's intentions. He thought the United States would retaliate with the same type of attack as we did in 1998 ... a four-day aerial attack,\" Piro said. \"He survived that one and he was willing to accept that type of attack.\" \n\n\"He didn't believe the U.S. would invade?\" Correspondent Scott Pelley asked. \n\n\"No, not initially,\" Piro answered. \n\nOnce it was clear that an invasion was imminent, Hussein asked his generals to hold off the allied forces for two weeks, Piro said. \"And at that point, it would go into what he called the secret war,\" the agent said, referring to the insurgency.

      "story": "Nokia Bell Labs (formerly named AT&T Bell Laboratories, Bell Telephone Laboratories and Bell Labs) is an American research and scientific development company, owned by Finnish company Nokia. Its headquarters are located in Murray Hill, New Jersey, in addition to other laboratories around the rest of the United States and in other countries. \n\nThe historic laboratory originated in the late 19th century as the Volta Laboratory and Bureau created by Alexander Graham Bell. Bell Labs was also at one time a division of the American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT&T Corporation), half-owned through its Western Electric manufacturing subsidiary. \n\nResearchers working at Bell Labs are credited with the development of radio astronomy, the transistor, the laser, the charge-coupled device (CCD), information theory, the operating systems Unix, Plan 9, Inferno, and the programming languages C, C++, and S. Eight Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work completed at Bell Laboratories. \n\nIn 1880, the French government awarded Alexander Graham Bell the Volta Prize of 50,000 francs, approximately US$10,000 at that time (about $ in current dollars) for the invention of the telephone. Bell used the award to fund the Volta Laboratory (\"Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory\") in Washington, D.C., in collaboration with Sumner Tainter and Bell's cousin Chichester Bell. The laboratory is also variously known as the \"Volta Bureau\", the \"Bell Carriage House\", the \"Bell Laboratory\" and the \"Volta Laboratory\". The laboratory focused on the analysis, recording, and transmission of sound. Bell used his considerable profits from the laboratory for further research and education to permit the \"[increased] diffusion of knowledge relating to the deaf\". This resulted in the founding of the Volta Bureau c. 1887, located at Bell's father's house at 1527 35th Street in Washington, D.C., where its carriage house became their headquarters in 1889. In 1893, Bell constructed a new building, close by at 1537 35th St., specifically to house the lab. The building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1972.",

While we were still engaged in questioning each other, I noticed that the countenance of our friend the scout wore an anxious and almost impatient expression. \n\n\"Anything wrong, Dobri?\" I inquired. \n\n\"God knows!\" he replied in a solemn tone, which impressed me much. \"A rumour has come that the Circassians or the Bashi-Bazouks--I know not which, but both are fiends and cowards--have been to Venilik, and--\" \n\nHe stopped abruptly. \n\n\"But that village was in the hands of the Russians,\" I said, at once understanding his anxiety. \n\n\"It may be so, but I go to see without delay,\" he replied, \"and have only stopped thus long to know if you will go with me. These brutes kill and wound women and children as well as men. Perhaps your services may--Will you go?\" \n\nHe spoke so earnestly, and his face looked so deadly pale, that I felt it impossible to refuse him. I was much exhausted by the prolonged labours of the day, but knew that I had reserve strength for an emergency. \n\n\"Give me a few minutes,\" said I,--\"just to get leave, you know. I can't go without leave.\" \n\nThe scout nodded. In ten minutes I had returned. Meanwhile, Lancey had prepared my horse and his own. Swallowing a can of water, I vaulted into the saddle. It was very dark, but Petroff knew every foot of the country. For several hours we rode at a smart gallop, and then, as day was breaking, drew near to Venilik. As we approached, I observed that the bold countenance of the scout became almost pinched-looking from anxiety. Presently we observed smoke against the sky, and then saw that the village had undoubtedly been burned. I glanced at Petroff nervously. There was no longer a look of anxiety on his face, but a dark vindictive frown. ",

David Berger has provided several principles of document writing, regarding the terms used, procedure numbering and even lengths of sentences, etc. \n\nThe following is a list of guides dealing with each specific field and type: \n\nThe procedures of documentation vary from one sector, or one type, to another. In general, these may involve document drafting, formatting, submitting, reviewing, approving, distributing, reposting and tracking, etc., and are convened by associated SOPs in a regulatory industry. It could also involve creating content from scratch. Documentation should be easy to read and understand. If it's too long and too wordy, it may be misunderstood or ignored. Clear, Short, Familiar words should be used to a maximum of 15 words to a sentence. Only gender hyper neutral word should be used and cultural biases should be avoided.

(commonly known as Columbia Pictures and Columbia, and formerly CBC Film Sales Corporation) is an American film studio, production company and film distributor that is a member of the Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, a division of Sony Entertainment's Sony Pictures subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate Sony. \n\nWhat would eventually become Columbia Pictures, CBC Film Sales Corporation, was founded on June 19, 1918 by Harry Cohn, his brother Jack Cohn, and Joe Brandt. It adopted the Columbia Pictures name in 1924, and went public two years later. Its name is derived from \"Columbia\", a national personification of the United States, which is used as the studio's logo. In its early years, it was a minor player in Hollywood, but began to grow in the late 1920s, spurred by a successful association with director Frank Capra. With Capra and others, Columbia became one of the primary homes of the screwball comedy. In the 1930s, Columbia's major contract stars were Jean Arthur and Cary Grant. In the 1940s, Rita Hayworth became the studio's premier star and propelled their fortunes into the late 1950s. Rosalind Russell, Glenn Ford, and William Holden also became major stars at the studio. \n\nIt is one of the leading film studios in the world, and is a member of the \"Big Six\" major American film studios. It was one of the so-called \"Little Three\" among the eight major film studios of Hollywood's Golden Age. Today, it has become the world's fifth largest major film studio.",

      "story": "CHAPTER XI \n\nMIGUEL TAKES CONTROL \n\nA black cloud rolled from _Mossamedes'_ funnel and blew across her bows. The beat of engines quickened and when the stern swung up their furious racing shook the ship. Kit pictured Macallister, sternly calm, at the throttle wheel. Much depended on his skill, for if he were slow when the spinning screw came down and the runaway machinery resumed its load, something must break. Kit, however, did not go to the engine-room. He stood at the door of the pilot-house, inside which Miguel S\u00e6nz gripped the slanted gratings with his bare feet. His face was wet by sweat and his brown hand was clenched on the steam-steering wheel. \n\nAlthough the muscular effort was not great, steering was hard. _Mossamedes_ rode high above water and the gale pressed upon her side; the combers lifted her, and screw and rudder could not get proper hold. Sometimes she came up to windward and rolled until the white seas swept her rail; sometimes she yawed to lee. Kit saw the bows circle and pictured the compass spinning in its bowl. \n\nSo far, Miguel steered by compass. Don Erminio had changed his course and headed obliquely for the shoals. It was not the course the gunboat's captain would expect him to steer. Revillon, no doubt, imagined the line along which _Mossamedes_ travelled inclined at a small angle out to sea, in order to clear the hammered sands, and he could steam down from his commanding position and cut her off. The line, however, really slanted the other way. Dark clouds obscured the sky, the light was bad, and the driving spray made accurate observation hard. Kit thought Don Erminio's plan was good, but longed for dark. ",

Then they went for lunch happily. \"I used the card, but I had thought it was mine. I didn't know it was Rose's until she looked for it. I was too afraid to explain it to her. So I decided to put the card back with some money secretly. I am sorry, Rose.\" Kate said in a low voice. \"It's just a misunderstanding !\" said the teacher. Tears came into Rose's eyes.

He was sixteen, his chestnut curls had given place to close-cropped brown locks, and he was more interested in football than fairies. But the bond between him and his old teacher still held. Kindred spirits alone do not change with changing years. \n\nIt was a wet, bleak, cruel evening in July when Anne came back to Green Gables. One of the fierce summer storms which sometimes sweep over the gulf was ravaging the sea. As Anne came in the first raindrops dashed against the panes. \n\n\"Was that Paul who brought you home?\" asked Marilla. \"Why didn't you make him stay all night. It's going to be a wild evening.\" \n\n\"He'll reach Echo Lodge before the rain gets very heavy, I think. Anyway, he wanted to go back tonight. Well, I've had a splendid visit, but I'm glad to see you dear folks again. 'East, west, hame's best.' Davy, have you been growing again lately?\" \n\n\"I've growed a whole inch since you left,\" said Davy proudly. \"I'm as tall as Milty Boulter now. Ain't I glad. He'll have to stop crowing about being bigger. Say, Anne, did you know that Gilbert Blythe is dying?\" Anne stood quite silent and motionless, looking at Davy.

She had given a fairly correct guess at the state of her daughter's affections, though she had not perhaps acknowledged to herself the intensity of her daughter's feelings. But the fact might not have mattered if it had never been told. Madeline might have overcome this love for Mr. Graham, and all might have been well if she had never mentioned it. But now the mischief was done. She had acknowledged to her mother,--and, which was perhaps worse, she had acknowledged to herself,--that her heart was gone, and Lady Staveley saw no cure for the evil. Had this happened but a few hours earlier she would have spoken with much less of encouragement to Peregrine Orme. \n\nAnd Felix Graham was not only in the house, but was to remain there for yet a while longer, spending a very considerable portion of his time in the drawing-room. He was to come down on this very day at three o'clock, after an early dinner, and on the next day he was to be promoted to the dining-room. As a son-in-law he was quite ineligible. He had, as Lady Staveley understood, no private fortune, and he belonged to a profession which he would not follow in the only way by which it was possible to earn an income by it. Such being the case, her daughter, whom of all girls she knew to be the most retiring, the least likely to speak of such feelings unless driven to it by great stress,--her daughter had positively declared to her that she was in love with this man!

      "story": "When NASA astronaut Scott Kelly completes his yearlong mission on the International Space Station next year, he'll come back just a little bit younger than his twin, Mark, than he was before. This is because time travels more slowly in space, a phenomenon first described by Albert Einstein's 1915 theory of general relativity. \n\nThis December, universities and academies around the world are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the theory's publication. \n\nEven 60 years after his death, Einstein is still the most important scientist of the modern era. Looking back as far as 2,400 years ago, only Newton, Galileo and Aristotle were his equals. \n\nBorn in the era of horse-drawn carriages, his ideas started a technological revolution that brought about more change in one century than in the 2,000 years before. \n\nIn 1905, Einstein published four important scientific papers. These completely changed people's ideas about space, time, light and matter. In one of these papers Einstein. introduced his theory of special relativity. Two groundbreaking parts of the theory were about the relationship between mass and energy and the speed of light. Einstein was able to show that mass and energy were connected through the formula E=MC2. The theory also says that no object can travel faster than the speed of light. \n\nAbout 10 years later came his theory of general relativity, the theory that modern physics is really based on. In Einstein's mathematics, space has three dimensions, and the fourth dimension is time. Space and time are part of one continuum, called space-time. The presence of mass changes space-time, which explains where gravity comes from. \n\nComputers, satellites, telecommunication, lasers, television and nuclear power, many of the biggest developments in the modern world, can be linked to Einstein's work. \n\n\"We are a different people than we were a century ago,\" said astrophysicist Michael Shara of the American Museum of Natural. History, \"completely different, because of Einstein.\" \n\nHowever, there's more to him beyond the image of a science mastermind. Einstein, as a person, has also become a grandfatherly icon in our culture. \n\nHe liked playing Mozart on his Violin and keeping fit by hiking and walking. Power was not his goal. In 1952, the young nation of Israel asked Einstein to be its president, but he refused. \n\nAnd, yes, he was eccentric. With hair like that, how could he not be?",

But with this issue in the back of my mind, I feel I can't do that,\" he testified on September 6. \n\nThe U.S. military does not have a policy to deal with such cases. Each is handled case-by-case, not by the military, but by immigration authorities. The government doesn't have numbers on how many military members are in predicaments similar to Gonzalez's. ",

      "story": "It was in 1865 that two Frenchmen were looking into the future. Edouard de Laboulaye, who studied history, admired the United States greatly. Frederic Auguste Bartholdi was a famous artist. De Laboulaye was thinking about 1876, when the country he respected so much would celebrate its 100th birthday. What gift would be good enough for the people of France to give? Right away, Bartholdi thought of a giant statue. \n\nBartholdi kept thinking about a statue for several years. Then, in 1871, he visited the United States and saw the perfect place for a huge statue. It was Bedloe's Island in New York. \n\nThe project -- the Statue of Liberty -- got started almost immediately, and Bartholdi went home to France to begin work. However, the statue was not finished in time for the 100th birthday. The United States Congress approved the use of Bedloe's Island on February 22, 1877. During the 100th celebration in 1876, the arm of the statue that would hold the torch was shown in Philadelphia. In 1879 the huge head was put on display in France. For the face of the statue, Bartholdi used his mother as a model. \n\nThe statue was finally completed in 1884. The work had been difficult enough, but then some really hard work began. The statue had to be taken apart and packed into boxes. It was not until May 1885 that the statue -- in pieces -- left France for its new home. \n\nThe statue arrived in June. However, the Americans fell behind on their part of the project. They hadn't raised enough money for building the base of the statue. People wondered if the country really needed or wanted such a gift. Finally, though, the money was raised and the base was completed. The last piece of the statue was put in place on October 28, 1886.",

The mainstream Hindu philosophy includes six systems (\u1e63a\u1e0ddar\u015bana) \u2013 Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Mimamsa and Vedanta. These are also called the Astika (orthodox) philosophical traditions and are those that accept the Vedas as authoritative, important source of knowledge.[note 1][note 2] Ancient and medieval India was also the source of philosophies that share philosophical concepts but rejected the Vedas, and these have been called n\u0101stika (heterodox or non-orthodox) Indian philosophies. N\u0101stika Indian philosophies include Buddhism, Jainism, C\u0101rv\u0101ka, \u0100j\u012bvika, and others. \n\nScholars have debated the relationship and differences within \u0101stika philosophies and with n\u0101stika philosophies, starting with the writings of Indologists and Orientalists of the 18th and 19th centuries, which were themselves derived from limited availability of Indian literature and medieval doxographies. The various sibling traditions included in Hindu philosophies are diverse, and they are united by shared history and concepts, same textual resources, similar ontological and soteriological focus, and cosmology.

Joan expected her elder sister, Sally, to be just as delighted as them. Joan had always admired Sally--the beauty and the star of the family--and felt happy about her achievements. \n\nBut since the baby's arrival, the sisters have become distant. Joan feels hurt for Sally seems completely uninterested in her baby. Sally, who has no children, claims that her younger sister \"acts as if no one ever had a baby before.\" \n\nNeither Sally nor Joan understands that the real cause of the current coldness is that their family roles have suddenly changed to the opposite. Finally Joan seems to be better than her elder sister--and Sally doesn't like it! Their distance may be temporary, but it shows that childhood competition don't fade easily as ages grow. It can remain powerful in relationships throughout life. \n\nIn a study of the University of Cincinnati, 65 men and women between ages 25 and 93 were asked how they felt about their brothers and sisters. Nearly 75 percent admitted having hidden competitive feelings. In a few cases, these emotions were so strong as to have affected their entire lives. \n\nMany adult brothers and sisters are close, supportive--yet still tend to compete. Two brothers I know turn into killers when on opposite sides of a tennis net. Off the court, they are the best of friends. My own younger sister can't wait to tell me when I've put on weight. However, she's a terrible cook and that pleases me; I tease her when she comes to dinner.

      "story": "(CNN) -- In the last week, Jeremy Lin has gone from an unknown professional basketball player struggling to get time on court to an overnight sporting and media sensation. CNN takes a closer look at the first U.S.-born player of Chinese or Taiwanese descent to play in the NBA, and how he's becoming more popular with every game. \n\nWho is Jeremy Lin? \n\nBorn to parents Shirley and Gie-Ming on August 23, 1988, Lin is an Asian-American NBA player for the New York Knicks. He wears the jersey No. 17 and plays as point guard. As a professional basketballer he's not overly tall, measuring 6 feet, 3 inches (191 centimeters) and weighs 200 pounds (90.7 kilograms). He played for four years at Harvard, and has spent just one year as a professional player. \n\nCareer highlights: \n\nFollowing his stint at Harvard (where he was twice named to the all-Ivy League), Lin failed to get drafted by an NBA franchise, and instead signed as a free agent with the Golden State Warriors in July, 2010. In December 2011, Lin signed with the New York Knicks after being cut by the Houston Rockets. His 109 points in his first four starts this past week have surpassed Allen Iverson's to become the most by any player since the NBA-ABA merger in 1976. \n\n'Linsanity': Why the hype? \n\nEveryone loves a battle-against-the-odds story, and Lin fits the bill perfectly. The reasons for his meteoric rise to become a U.S. basketball sensation are numerous, but it all starts with talent. In just weeks he's gone from one-time bench-warmer to team savior, leading the Knicks to five straight victories and averaging more than 20 points per game, while his field goal percentage during this winning streak tops 50%. In Friday's game against Kobe Bryant's L.A. Lakers, he reeled off 38 points in that victory alone. ",

They are the two largest landlocked sounds in the United States. \n\nThe coastal plain transitions to the Piedmont region along the Atlantic Seaboard fall line, a line which marks the elevation at which waterfalls first appear on streams and rivers.

Small, isolated, and deeply eroded mountain ranges and peaks are located in the Piedmont, including the Sauratown Mountains, Pilot Mountain, the Uwharrie Mountains, Crowder's Mountain, King's Pinnacle, the Brushy Mountains, and the South Mountains. The Piedmont ranges from about 300 to 400 feet (91 to 122 m) in elevation in the east to over 1,000 feet (300 m) in the west. Because of the rapid population growth in the Piedmont, a significant part of the rural area in this region is being transformed into suburbs with shopping centers, housing, and corporate offices.

Because the new show is, I believe, an inevitable disappointment for hardcore \"Closer\" fans. As for those of us who are Mary McDonnell fans? Ambivalence reigns! \n\nFirst of all, the exit of Sedgwick's Brenda Leigh Johnson.

Then Johnson abruptly accepted a new job (something like chief of bureau of investigations L.A. liason officer in the D.A.'s office -- it sounded like the longest-titled cushy job possible) and lit out, munching a signature bit of junk food. \n\nOver the years, \"The Closer\" had become a light-comedy crime show with heavy-handed humor performed not just by Sedgwick but also the supporting cast that has migrated over to \"Major Crimes,\" especially G.W. Bailey, whose slow burns have become endless fuming, and, only by contrast to a lesser extent, Tony Denison, Michael Paul Chan, Raymond Cruz, and Phillip P. Keene.

      "story": "I call my story the story of a bad boy, partly to distinguish myself from those faultless young gentlemen, and partly because I really was not an angle. I may truthfully say I was a friendly, impulsive teenager. I didn't want to be an angel. In short, I was a real human boy, such as you may meet anywhere in New England. \n\nWhenever a new scholar came to our school, I used to ask him \" My name's Tom Bailey; what's your name?\" If the name struck me favorably, I shook hands with the new pupil _ , but if it didn't, I would turn and walk away, for I was particular on this point. \n\nI was born in Rivermouth almost fifty years ago, but, before I became very well acquainted with that pretty New England town, my parents moved to New Orleans. I was only eighteen months old at the time of the move, and it didn't make much difference to me where I was, because several years later, when my father proposed to take me North to be educated, I had my own view on the subject. I instantly kicked over the little boy, Sam, who happened to be standing by me at the moment, and declared that I would not be taken away to live among a lot of Yankees! You see I was what is called \" a Northern man with Southern principles,\" I had no recollection of New England: my earliest memories were connected with the South. I knew I was born in the North, but hoped nobody would find it out. I never told my schoolmates I was a Yankee, because they talked about Yankees in a scornful way which made me feel that it was quite a shame not to be born in the South. \n\nAnd this impression was strengthened by Aunt Chloe, who said, \"There wasn't no gentlemen in the North no way.\" \n\nWith this picture of Northern civilization in my eye, the readers will easily understand my terror at the bare thought of being transported to Rivermouth to school, and possibly will forgive me for kicking over little Sam, when my father announced this to me. As for kicking little Sam, I always did that, more or less gently, when anything went wrong with me. \n\nMy father was greatly troubled by this violent behavior. As little Sam picked himself up, my father took my hand in his and led me thoughtfully to the library. He appeared strangely puzzled on learning the nature of my objections to going North. \n\n\"Who on earth, Tom, has filled your brain with those silly stories?\" asked my father calmly. \n\n\"Aunt Chloe, sir, she told me.\" \n\nMy father devoted that evening and several evenings to giving me a clear account of New England: its early struggles, its progress, and its present condition. I was no longer unwilling to go North; on the contrary, the proposed journey to a new world full of wonders kept me awake nights. Long before the moving day arrived I was eager to be off. My impatience was increased by the fact that my father had purchased for me a fine little Mustang pony, and shipped it to Rivermouth two weeks before the date set for our own journey. The pony completely resigned me to the situation. The pony's name was Gitana, which is the Spanish for \"gypsy\", so I always called her Gypsy. \n\nFinally the time came to leave the vine-covered mansion among the orange-trees, to say goodbye to little Sam(I am convince he was heartily glad to get rid of me), and to part with Aunt Chloe. I imagine them standing by the open garden gate; the tears are rolling down Aunt Chloe's cheeks; they and the old home fade away. I am never to see them again!",

The modern state of Orissa was established on 1 April 1936, as a province in British India, and consisted predominantly of Odia-speaking regions. April 1 is celebrated as Odisha Day. The region is also known as Utkala and is mentioned in India's national anthem, \"Jana Gana Mana\". Cuttack was made the capital of the region by Anantavarman Chodaganga in c. 1135, after which the city was used as the capital by many rulers, through the British era until 1948. Thereafter, Bhubaneswar became the capital of Odisha.",

      "story": "New York (CNN) -- Rapper Lil Wayne will go directly to jail after he is sentenced by a Manhattan judge Tuesday afternoon for a gun conviction, according to a person familiar with the case. \n\nDwayne Carter, as he is known legally, pleaded guilty to felony gun charges in a deal with prosecutors October 2009. He is expected to get a one-year prison sentence. \n\nHis sentencing was delayed three weeks so he could get some dental work done, including removal of his diamond-studded braces. \n\nThe person familiar with the case would not confirm where Wayne would serve his sentence. \n\nThe plea agreement was a result of the rapper's 2007 arrest outside New York's Beacon Theater. \n\nAccording to police, Wayne had a .40-caliber pistol on his tour bus. \n\n\"It's not his gun, they know whose gun it is,\" Wayne's attorney, Stacey Richman, said after a hearing last month. \n\nIn an unrelated case, Wayne also faces felony drug possession and weapons charges in the state of Arizona. \n\nLil Wayne is a multiplatinum-selling and Grammy-winning rap artist. His hits include \"The Block is Hot\" and \"Lollipop,\" and his album \"Tha Carter III\" was the top-selling disc of 2008. His latest album, \"Rebirth,\" was released last month. \n\nCNN's Jennifer Rizzo contributed to this report. \n\n",

      "story": "Is getting a black belt on your life's to-do list? Then this elderly woman in San Francisco just might be your hero. Just two years before her 100th birthday, Sensei Keiko Fukuda has become the first woman to achieve a tenth-degree black belt --- the highest rank in Judo . Fukuda is now one of only four living people who have earned the tenth-degree black belt. Throughout history, only 16 people have ever achieved this honor. Fukuda began practicing Judo in 1935 and is the only surviving student of its founder, Kano Jiguro. At her teacher's requirement, she learned English to help spread Judo internationally. During a time when getting married, building a family and becoming a housewife were the norms ,Fukuda broke from tradition, continuing Judo instead of getting married. \"All I did was Judo ... This was my marriage,\" Fukuda replied tearfully to the San Francisco Chronicle. \"This is when my destiny was set. I just imagined how long the road would be.\" She described the Jiguro's school as \"old-fashioned and sexist about belts and ranks\". In fact, an edict that prevented women from achieving any higher than a fifth-degree black belt kept Fukuda at that level for 30 years. She finally got the sixth degree in 1972 when a women's division was created. Fukuda thinks Judo and her life to be \"gentle, kind and beautiful, yet firm and strong, both mentally and physically\". Fukuda says this kind of beauty is not external . She explained. \"I believe this inner beauty is true beauty... All my life this has been my dream.\" Her dream was turned into reality, and the 98-year-old Sensei Keiko Fukuda continues to teach Judo three times a week at a women's Judo training center.",

The PIF animal shelter is crammed with almost 1,000 dogs of all sizes, ages and breeds (though the number that can claim any sort of pedigree is probably in single figures). \n\nMany are orphans of the conflict that has shaken this city for the past six months. Their owners have left or in a few cases been killed by the shelling. Some have been discovered tied up and emaciated; others carry the scars of shrapnel or hobble around on three legs. There are several in every cage, with a handful of straw to protect them from temperatures that plunge far below freezing at night. \n\nThe director of the sanctuary is Victoria Vasilieva, a tall middle-aged woman with jet black hair, whose compassion for the animals in her care is unstinting. She cradles a young dog called Jennifer, the only survivor when a shell hit her family's home near the airport. Jennifer was found traumatized in the ruins and it has taken weeks to gain her trust. \n\nVasilieva says that the dogs here used to be terrified by the sounds of war. Now, like the people of Donetsk, they hardly notice them. \n\nInside the office block, a puppy -- mostly black Labrador - is recovering from a broken leg and shrapnel wound. Vats of oatmeal are cooking in the yard. It's like feeding an army. A few very lucky dogs are going to new homes in Germany, Finland and Russia, but the great majority will remain at the shelter so long as there is money to feed them. ",

Eisenhower established NASA in 1958 with a distinctly civilian (rather than military) orientation encouraging peaceful applications in space science. The National Aeronautics and Space Act was passed on July 29, 1958, disestablishing NASA's predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). The new agency became operational on October 1, 1958. \n\nSince that time, most US space exploration efforts have been led by NASA, including the Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab space station, and later the Space Shuttle. Currently, NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing the development of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, the Space Launch System and Commercial Crew vehicles. The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program (LSP) which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for unmanned NASA launches. \n\nNASA science is focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System, advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research Program, exploring bodies throughout the Solar System with advanced robotic spacecraft missions such as \"New Horizons\", and researching astrophysics topics, such as the Big Bang, through the Great Observatories and associated programs.

James hoped to see the puppy again. Many days later James went for a walk again. He thought to himself, \"I guess I won't ever see the brown puppy again. I hoped to see him again.\" A nice young lady said to James, \"Would you like a puppy?\" James said, \"I would like a puppy that was like the one I petted before.\" The lady smiled. She was holding the little brown and spotted puppy. She told James that she found the little puppy in the woods. She said that the little puppy did not have a family. James said happily, \"I would love to give the puppy a home!\" So James grabbed the little brown and spotted puppy and took him home. James and the little brown puppy became great friends. James named him Spotty.",

      "story": "(CNN) -- Robert Barchi believed he had much more important business to deal with at Rutgers, and in many ways, he's probably right. He is overseeing a massive merger between the university and the state's medical schools, one that will shape higher education in New Jersey for generations. \n\nBut now there was an issue involving a videotape of his basketball coach. This was early December, just after Rutgers had received a much-celebrated invitation to the Big Ten Conference. The tape contained clips of Mike Rice throwing basketballs at his players, shoving them and cursing at them, and using a homophobic slur. \n\nWhen it was given to ESPN months later, it dominated the airwaves for a week and sparked a scandal that rocked the Rutgers athletic department and, for many alums, disgraced the school. \n\nThe tape was toxic. The tape overshadowed everything Barchi was trying to accomplish on the New Brunswick, New Jersey, campus. But he never watched that tape until after it aired. \n\n\"It was a revelation,\" Barchi said a few weeks later, \"that the intensity of the response, both within the community, within the state and nationally on this very important and very serious issue could totally swamp out all of the other issues we're trying to deal with and color everything else we're doing.\" \n\nRevelation isn't the right word. Reality is. Barchi isn't the first university president -- and he won't be the last -- to learn how a scandal in college athletics can shape his administration or, for some, end it entirely. ",

However, he is now a household film star in China. \n\nWang is the youngest child of a poor family in Hebei Province. Dreaming of becoming an actor, he left home at the age of 8 to study kung fu at Shaolin Temple, since kung-fu actors seemed to appear most often on the big screen. \n\nAt 14, he moved to Beijing for his acting career for the first time, with little money in his pocket. He worked at a construction site for 20 to 25 yuan per day, and spent his free time standing in front of the Beijing Film Studio, eager to be chosen as temporary actors. This was the hardest time for the boy. His opportunity finally came one day after he went for a role in the movie \"Blind Shaft\" . He was chosen to play a young coal miner. The movie won him three prizes in Thailand, France and Taiwan. But his success didn`t make any difference to his life. \n\nThat year, he went home for the Spring Festival. He gave his family his earnings from the movie, around $ 250 and then returned to Beijing with 500 yuan, the same amount he had when he first came to the city. His life was as simple as before. \n\nThanks to his natural performance in \"Blind Shaft\", he was invited by the famous director Feng Xiaogang to act in the film \"A World Without Thieves\" in 2004, which made him famous immediately. People called him \"Shagen\", the name of his character in the movie. \n\nWang's work, \"Soldiers Sortie\" has made him the most popular actor on the Chinese mainland. For the actor, it's a dream coming true. \n\n\"Dreams come true. I think my life is exactly a course of pursuing dreams. No matter how tough one thing is,I can make it as long as I put great effort into it. \"he said.",

And the secret says: 'I feel guilty when I take lifts for one floor, so I limp when I get out.'\" Frank said. \n\nTen years ago, Mr. Warren created an art project called PostSecret. People then began to send him postcards, other objects and emails telling their secrets. Every Sunday, he chooses 10 secrets and puts them on the website. \n\nMr. Warren says he created PostSecret so people could share their secrets in a safe place. \"I was struggling with secrets in my own life. And it was by creating this safe place where others could share their secrets with me, I think that space was something I needed just as much as they did.\" \n\nHe has published six books full of the secrets people have shared with him. One secret in each book is his. Eric Perry delivers mail for the U.S. Postal Service. He has brought thousands of secrets to Frank's home over the past three years. \"I have a couple of the books that Frank's given me and I've read them all and my family has read them all and it's wild!\" \n\nThe project itself was once one of Frank's secrets. His wife Jan didn't know exactly what he was doing until the first book was published. The publisher told him that the address was going to be on the book, and he refused. However, the address was there just because of the contract between them. Actually Warren wasn't very happy about that. \n\nSome people tell Frank of their secret desire to kill themselves.

I have here with me a drawing of the armour in use with us. You see they have helmets of an acorn shape, with a rim turning up in front; gauntlets, buff coats well padded in front, and large breast plates. The pikes vary from fourteen to eighteen feet long according to the taste of the commander. We generally use about sixteen.

Several cases were before the courts undecided, and until a decision was reached, the owners of the patent would do all in their power to prevent any one from interfering in the business which they proposed to make a monopoly. Therefore, when Bob went about his work, he did so with quite as much mystery as if he had been engaged in some decidedly unlawful act. \n\nThe ride from Sawyer, among the mountains, was quite as rough a one as that from Bradford, and Ralph found that he had about as much as he could attend to in keeping the guns, fishing-rods and himself in the carriage, without attempting to carry on any extended conversation with his friend.

      "story": "Horror is a genre of fiction which is intended to, or has the capacity to frighten, scare, disgust, or startle its readers or viewers by inducing feelings of horror and terror. Literary historian J. A. Cuddon has defined the horror story as \"a piece of fiction in prose of variable length... which shocks or even frightens the reader, or perhaps induces a feeling of repulsion or loathing\". It creates an eerie and frightening atmosphere. Horror is frequently supernatural, though it can be non-supernatural. Often the central menace of a work of horror fiction can be interpreted as a metaphor for the larger fears of a society. \n\nThe genre of horror has ancient origins with roots in folklore and religious traditions, focusing on death, the afterlife, evil, the demonic and the principle of the thing embodied in the person. These were manifested in stories of beings such as witchcraft, vampires, werewolves and ghosts. European horror fiction became established through works by the Ancient Greeks and Ancient Romans. In Greek mythology, Prometheus was a Titan who was the inspiration for the title of \"Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus\". Prometheus' earliest known appearance is in Hesiod's \"Theogony\". However, the story of Frankenstein was influenced far greater on the story of Hippolytus. Asclepius revived Hippolytus from death. Euripides wrote plays based on the story, \"Hippolytos Kalyptomenos\" and \"Hippolytus (play).\" Plutarch's \"The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans: Cimon\" describes the spirit of the murderer,Damon , who himself was murdered in a bathhouse in Chaeronea. Pliny the Younger describes Athenodorus Cananites who bought a haunted house in Athens. Athenodorus was cautious since the house was inexpensive. As Athenodorus writes a book a philosophy, he is visited by an aberration bound in chains. The figure disappears in the courtyard; the following day, the magistrates dig up the courtyard to find an unmarked grave.",

By contrast, the format was much more popular in Japan and in the more affluent regions of Southeast Asia, such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia, being the prevalent rental video medium in Hong Kong during the 1990s. Its superior video and audio quality did make it a somewhat popular choice among videophiles and film enthusiasts during its lifespan. \n\nLaserDisc was first available on the market, in Atlanta, Georgia, on December 15, 1978, two years after the introduction of the VHS VCR, and four years before the introduction of the CD (which is based on laser disc technology).

With a population of two million, it is the 10th largest city of Pakistan, while the larger Islamabad-Rawalpindi metropolitan area is the third largest in Pakistan with a population exceeding five\u00a0million. The city is the political seat of Pakistan and is administered by the Islamabad Metropolitan Corporation, supported by the Capital Development Authority (CDA). \n\nIslamabad is located in the Pothohar Plateau in the northeastern part of the country, between Rawalpindi District and the Margalla Hills National Park to the north. The region has historically been a part of the crossroads of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with the Margalla Pass acting as the gateway between the two regions. \n\nIslamabad was built during the 1960s to replace Karachi as Pakistan's capital. The city's master-plan divides the city into eight zones, including administrative, diplomatic enclave, residential areas, educational sectors, industrial sectors, commercial areas, and rural and green areas. The city is known for the presence of several parks and forests, including the Margalla Hills National Park and Shakarparian Park. The city is home to several landmarks, including the Faisal Mosque, the largest mosque in South Asia and the fourth largest in the world. Other landmarks include the Pakistan's National Monument and Democracy Square.",

But she did run. With the cheers of friends and strangers reaching her heart, Williams set a C.W. Post record in Boston. Now she will run again, in the national Division II cross-country championships in Evansville, Ind. She wanted to be sure she was doing the right thing by running. She was the middle of three sisters, between Kerry, who is 25, and Jennifer, who was 18. \n\nJust going through any motions was hard enough, but Christine Williams wanted to know if she should put on her uniform and her shoes and run through the woods on an autumn afternoon, in the awful gaping time between her sister's wake and her funeral. \"I kind of got upset beforehand.\" Williams admitted. Not a chatterbox under normal conditions, she now holds herself the best way she can, the fewer words the better. She almost walked away from the start line. But her friend Angela Toscano, who had flown up to Boston with her, directly from the wake, was standing near the line and talked her through it. \"She said my sister would have wanted me to run.\" Christine said. And that was enough to get her started. \n\nThe accident happened just after midnight on Nov, 4. Four young women were driving in an unfamiliar area of Long Island in Eastport, N.Y., when one of them apparently ran a yield sign, and the car was hit by another vehicle. Heather Brownrigg and Jennifer Williams died, and their friends April Brown and Kaci Moran were treated at a hospital and released. \n\nThe crash made the papers. April Brown was charged with drunken driving and driving without a license. \n\nThe wake began on Nov. 6. The next day Christine was to run with the Post cross-country team at the regional meet. Rich Degnan, the Post coach,\"and Post officials offered a car service and tickets on the last flight-to Boston for Christine and Toscano. When they arrived at the hotel, the entire team was waiting up for her. \n\nEverybody knew about it at the regional meet. Degnan had to arrange for the flexibility of an alternate, just in case Christine could not go. Several times during the race, Christine felt she could not continue. But then she heard her friends and all those other people, those strangers from other colleges, calling her name. She thought about Jennifer. And she ran. She finished fourth in 22 minutes 58 seconds, breaking the Post record for the 6-kilometer distance by 15 seconds. And although the Post team didn't qualify for the nationals, Christine did.",

      "story": "In plant taxonomy, commelinids (originally commelinoids) (plural, not capitalised) is a name used by the APG IV system for a clade within the monocots, which in its turn is a clade within the angiosperms. The commelinids are the only clade that the APG has informally named within the monocots. The remaining monocots are a paraphyletic unit. Also known as the commelinid monocots it forms one of three groupings within the monocots, and the final branch, the other two groups being the alismatid monocots and the lilioid monocots. \n\nMembers of the commelinid clade have cell walls containing UV-fluorescent ferulic acid. \n\nThe commelinids were first recognized as a formal group in 1967 by Armen Takhtajan, who named them the Commelinidae and assigned them to a subclass of the monocots. However, by the release of his 1980 system of classification, he had merged this subclass into a larger one no longer considered to be a clade. \n\nThe commelinids constitute a well-supported clade within the monocots, and this clade has been recognized in all four APG classification systems. \n\nThe commelinids of APG II (2003) and APG III (2009) contain essentially the same plants as the commelinoids of the earlier APG system (1998). In APG IV (2016) the family Dasypogonaceae is no longer directly placed under commelinids but instead a family of order Arecales.",

In April, Gentle said that \"the extradition request is politically motivated. It is legally flawed, and he has nothing to hide.\" \n\nGanic was the vice president of Bosnia during the civil war there between 1992 and 1995 and was twice president of the Bosnian-Croat Federation in the years following the 1995 Dayton peace agreement. Many independent commentators at the time regarded Ganic as a relative moderate in the wartime Bosnian leadership. \n\nThough Bosnian, Ganic was born in Serbia and speaks with a recognizable Serbian accent. He holds dual nationality in the former Yugoslav republics. \n\nHe is leaving London for Sarajevo on Wednesday, he said. \n\nCNN's Andrew Carey contributed to this report. \n\n",

Gbagbo defied calls to step down after an electoral commission declared he lost a presidential election in November to Alassane Ouattara. Ouattara has been recognized internationally as the legitimate winner. \n\nA violent power struggle followed the standoff, with supporters loyal to both sides taking to the streets in protests since December. Hundreds have been killed, according to the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross. \n\nAndris Piebalgs, EU commissioner for development, announced the recovery package on Tuesday. \n\n\"We will stand by Ivory Coast and its people by immediately starting to work with the government of President Ouattara to support him in getting the country on the right track towards reconciliation, democracy, economic recovery and sustainable development,\" he said. \n\nThe funding will provide support to ensure basic needs for citizens such as health, water, sanitation and to support the agricultural sector, Piebalgs said in a statement. It also will clear the Ivory Coast's debt accumulated through the European Investment Bank. \n\nTop military brass pledged their support to Ouattara in a ceremony Tuesday at a hotel in Abdijan. Gen. Phillipe Mangou, Gbagbo's former army chief of staff, said on state television that the generals were received by Ouattara and given orders to take measures to restore order in the country. ",

The state is bisected by the Missouri River, dividing South Dakota into two geographically and socially distinct halves, known to residents as \"East River\" and \"West River\". \n\nEastern South Dakota is home to most of the state's population, and the area's fertile soil is used to grow a variety of crops. West of the Missouri, ranching is the predominant agricultural activity, and the economy is more dependent on tourism and defense spending. Most of the Native American reservations are in West River.

Scott, LAY OF THE LAST MINSTREL \n\n'Ill news, Martin, I see by your look!' cried Eustacie, starting to her feet from the heap of straw on which she was sitting in his cowhouse, one early April day, about seven weeks since her evasion from the convent. \n\n'Not so, I hope, Madame, but I do not feel at ease. Monsieur has not sent for me, nor told me his plans for the morrow, and I much doubt me whether that bode not a search here. Now I see a plan, provided Madame would trust herself to a Huguenot.' \n\n'They would guard me for my husband's sake.' \n\n'And could Madame walk half a league, as far as the Grange du Temple? There live Matthieu Rotrou and his wife, who have, they say, baffled a hundred times the gendarmes who sought their ministers. No one ever found a pastor, they say, when Rotrou had been of the congregation; and if they can do so much for an old preacher with a long tongue, surely they can for a sweet young lady; and if they could shelter her just for tomorrow, till the suspicion is over, then would I come for Madame with my cart, and carry her into Chollet among the trusses of hay, as we had fixed.'

He plainly saw the wish of Charles was to call into his camp such Frenchmen as, from their small number and high quality, might be considered rather as hostages than as auxiliaries; but, observant of Crevecoeur's advice, he assented as readily to whatever the Duke proposed, as if it had arisen from the free impulse of his own mind. \n\nThe King failed not, however, to indemnify himself for his complaisance by the indulgence of his vindictive temper against Balue, whose counsels had led him to repose such exuberant trust in the Duke of Burgundy. Tristan, who bore the summons for moving up his auxiliary forces, had the farther commission to carry the Cardinal to the Castle of Loches, and there shut him up in one of those iron cages which he himself is said to have invented.

Then they would buy toys and sweets. The grandparents commented that, behaving like this, the children would never learn to manage their money. So they planned a special test, in which the children would have to show, over the course of a year, just what they could manage to get with those few coins. \n\nSome thought that they would save their money, but Rubin and Nico continued spending it all on sweets. So they give up saving. \n\nMonty decided to manage his money by exchanging it: buying and selling things, or bettering it with others. Soon he surprised the whole family. He had accumulated lots of money. However, Monty was not very careful, and he got involved in more and more risky deals. A few months later he became penniless after a losing bet. \n\nAlex, had a will of iron. He saved the money and at the end of the year he had collected more money than anyone. Even better, with so much money, he had managed to buy sweets at a reduced price, so that on the day of the competition he was presented with enough sweets for more than a year. And even then, he still had enough left for a toy. He was the clear winner, and other children learnt the advantages of knowing how to save and how to wait. \n\nThere was also Julia. Poor Julia didn't enjoy the competition because even though she had a wonderful secret plan, she had spent her money without giving her plan enough time to work. However, she was so sure that her plan was a good one, that she decided to carry on with it, and maybe change the expressions on her s' faces, who had seemed to be saying \"What a disaster that girl is. She couldn't manage to save anything.\" \n\nWhen she was about to complete the second year of her plan, Julia surprised everyone by turning up at the grandparents' house with a violin and a lot of money.

That incident is believed to be the first attack on a foreign ambassador in South Korea. \n\n-- Kim allegedly harbored sympathies for North Korea, according to Korean media reports. Yonhap reported that Kim had visited North Korea six times between 2006 and 2007, had attempted to erect a memorial for former North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il in Seoul, and once set himself on fire in front of the presidential office. \n\n-- He was frequently seen at protests, wearing a beret and blaming U.S. policies for straining relations between North and South Korea. \n\nKim was a member of the Korea Council For Reconciliation and Cooperation, which hosted Lippert at the Thursday event where the attack occurred. The group advocates reunification of the Koreas as well as humanitarian aid to North Korea. Kim was one of its 181 members, but wasn't on the list of those invited for the event, according to police. But he was allowed in because an event staff recognized him from the organization. ",

He has not been seen in public since news of the scandal emerged, and he was stripped of his role as Chongqing party chief and later his prestigious politburo post. \n\nTIMELINE: Bo's fall from grace \n\nBo stands accused of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power. According to the indictment documents, as a civil servant he took advantage of his position to seek profit from others and accepted an extremely large amount of money and properties, Xinhua reported. The documents don't quantify the amount of bribes allegedly accepted, but published reports say it could be as much as 20 million yuan ($3.3 million). ",

The former contractor with the National Security Agency accused authorities of misusing some of the capabilities he observed, and acting without a judicial or statutory basis. \n\nKlayman, using himself as an aggrieved party from the surveillance, used the lawsuit to accuse the government of conducting \"a secret and illegal government scheme to intercept and analyze vast quantities of domestic telephonic communications,\" along with communications \"from the internet and electronic service providers.\" \n\nTuesday he said he has the standing to bring the suit as a customer of Verizon, one of the companies known to be cooperating with warrantless surveillance.

She knows how much her children yearn to see their dad, but she just doesn't know what to tell them. \n\nHow can she begin to explain that their dad has languished in a Saudi prison for almost a year? How can she expose her kids to a brutal reality she feels they're not ready to face? \n\n\"They're always asking me, 'When is Dad coming home?' \" Haidar said. \"Telling me, 'Mom, I miss Dad so much.' \" \n\nHaidar struggles with the dilemma every day. \n\n\"It often feels like the world is against me,\" she said. \"When I see how the children are deprived of their father, this is what bothers me the most.\" \n\nHer three children, including 5-year-old Myriam, think their father's just delayed by work. But Raif Badawi, 30, has been imprisoned since being arrested in June. He is accused of, among other things, breaking Sharia law and starting a website that infringed on religious values. \n\nAccording to Haidar, her husband just wanted to encourage discussion about religion in his homeland. But starting a liberal Internet forum in conservative Saudi Arabia can be a dangerous pursuit. \n\n\"No one wanted to take his case,\" said Waleed Abualkhair, Badawi's attorney. \"Because they believed that anyone who'd take this kind of case, that means he destroys his (own) reputation. But I don't believe in that. I believe that everyone has his right to have a lawyer. And I believe that Raif is innocent.\" ",

      "story": "A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \"planet\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \"planets\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. \n\nThe planets were thought by Ptolemy to orbit Earth in deferent and epicycle motions. Although the idea that the planets orbited the Sun had been suggested many times, it was not until the 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first telescopic astronomical observations, performed by Galileo Galilei. At about the same time, by careful analysis of pre-telescopic observation data collected by Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler found the planets' orbits were not circular but elliptical. As observational tools improved, astronomers saw that, like Earth, the planets rotated around tilted axes, and some shared such features as ice caps and seasons. Since the dawn of the Space Age, close observation by space probes has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics, and even hydrology.",

The farmers who lived there were the Nixon family. They grew corn. Sometimes when the weather was right, they would plant wheat, too. The fields were so large that the class could not see where they ended. Mr. Nixon gave all of the children a long ride in the fields on his tractor. The Nixon family also had a lot of farm animals. In the red barn next to their home, they kept a few cows and horses. Everyone fed hay to some of the cows. The farmers got milk from their cows. Some of the class got small bottles of fresh milk to take home with them. All the kids got to ride on the big brown horses the Nixons had. They went up into the nearby hills, where they could look down on the farm below. Around the farmyard there were many goats and chickens, who wandered around as they wished. The Nixon children liked to play with their goats, feed them peanut shells and pet them, like the first grade kids did with their dogs and cats. The smallest tried to bump the children with their hard heads and tiny horns! When it was almost dark, the school kids got back on the bus to go home. They were a little sad to leave the fun life of the farm children. But they brought back stories for all the rest of the school to hear.",

She joined them. \n\n\"Oh, my dear!\" cried Mrs. Chandos, interrupting Honora's apologies, \"I'm sure I shan't sleep a wink--she gave me such a fright. You might have sent Trixy ahead to prepare us.

      "story": "(CNN) -- Nasser Al-Attiyah has called time on the defense of his Dakar Rally title, pulling out of the 2012 race after problems with his car. \n\nThe Qatari quit the annual race across South America after his temperamental Hummer broke down on the ninth stage between Antofagasta and Iquique in Chile. \n\nAl-Attiyah has endured a litany of problems with his vehicle since the start of the race on New Year's Day and threw in the towel after 174km of the ninth stage having made three unscheduled stops. \n\nAmerican Bobby Gordon didn't have any such problems as he claimed his first stage win in the 2012 race to further close the gap on overall leader Stephane Peterhansel. \n\nGordon cuts Peterhansel's lead in stage eight \n\nThe Frenchman -- a six-time motorbike and three-time car champion in the Dakar -- finished a minute and 38 seconds behind Gordon, with Spain's Nani Roma third. \n\nWith four days remaining in the race Gordon, a NASCAR veteran, trails Peterhansel by nearly six minutes in the overall standings. \n\nHe said: \"We had a couple of big scary moments. For us, we've got to make time. We're in a different position to him (Peterhansel). He has to conserve his time and I've got to make it. \n\n\"We've got four days left, four real days of racing left and the Hummer's strong. I can't believe he could catch us there, because we were going crazy. So he's a madman; if he beats us, he's a madman. Madder than me!\" \n\nIn the motorbike classification, Cyril Despres won stage nine to return to the top of the overall standings in his seesaw battle with Spain's Mark Como. ",

Ron Clark was a young white guy from North Carolina who talked with a funny Southern accent . He said he used to be a singing waiter. I thought, who is this guy? He's a complete joke. \n\nIt was 1999 and I was in the fifth grade at New York City's P.S. 83. _ . I'd always been a troublemaker. I'd get yelled at, and then the teachers would give up on me. I thought that's what would happen with Ron Clark. \n\nI was wrong. That first week, I kept mocking him. He pulled me out to the hallway and said I'd better shape up. \"Tamara,\" he said, \"you're a smart kid. You can do better.\" \n\nHe told me I was a natural leader and that I'd go far in life if I started applying myself. I was mad at first, but then something happened: I began to respect him. There were 29 students in our class, and it didn't take long for us to realize that Ron Clark was no ordinary teacher. \n\nHe was only 27 and had the most unusual way of teaching. To help us learn the states and capitals, he changed the lyrics of a popular rap hit called \"Thong Song\" and had us sing and dance with him. When we read the Harry Potter books, he decorated our classroom like Hogwarts. And during the Presidential election, he put campaign posters on the walls and covered the room with 5,000 red, white and blue stars.",

      "story": "The American Revolution was a colonial revolt that took place between 1765 and 1783. The American Patriots in the Thirteen Colonies won independence from Great Britain, becoming the United States of America. They defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War in alliance with France and others. \n\nMembers of American colonial society argued the position of \"no taxation without representation\", starting with the Stamp Act Congress in 1765. They rejected the authority of the British Parliament to tax them because they lacked representation in Parliament. Protests steadily escalated to the burning of the \"Gaspee\" in Rhode Island in 1772, followed by the Boston Tea Party in 1773, during which patriots destroyed a consignment of taxed tea. The British responded by closing Boston Harbor, then followed with a series of legislative acts which effectively rescinded Massachusetts Bay Colony's rights of self-government and caused the other colonies to rally behind Massachusetts. In late 1774, the Patriots set up their own alternative government to better coordinate their resistance efforts against Great Britain; other colonists preferred to remain aligned to the British Crown and were known as Loyalists or Tories. \n\nTensions erupted into battle between Patriot militia and British regulars when the British attempted to capture and destroy Colonial military supplies at Lexington and Concord in April 1775. The conflict then developed into a global war, during which the Patriots (and later their French, Spanish, and Dutch allies) fought the British and Loyalists in what became known as the American Revolutionary War (1775\u201383). Each of the thirteen colonies formed a Provincial Congress that assumed power from the old colonial governments and suppressed Loyalism, and from there they built a Continental Army under the leadership of General George Washington. The Continental Congress determined King George's rule to be tyrannical and infringing the colonists' rights as Englishmen, and they declared the colonies free and independent states on July 2, 1776. The Patriot leadership professed the political philosophies of liberalism and republicanism to reject monarchy and aristocracy, and they proclaimed that all men are created equal.",

Before his accession to the throne, he served as heir apparent and held the title of Prince of Wales for longer than any of his predecessors. During the long reign of his mother, he was largely excluded from political power, and came to personify the fashionable, leisured elite. He travelled throughout Britain performing ceremonial public duties, and represented Britain on visits abroad. His tours of North America in 1860 and the Indian subcontinent in 1875 were popular successes, but despite public approval his reputation as a playboy prince soured his relationship with his mother. \n\nAs king, Edward played a role in the modernisation of the British Home Fleet and the reorganisation of the British Army after the Second Boer War. He reinstituted traditional ceremonies as public displays and broadened the range of people with whom royalty socialised. He fostered good relations between Britain and other European countries, especially France, for which he was popularly called \"Peacemaker\", but his relationship with his nephew, the German Emperor Wilhelm II, was poor. The Edwardian era, which covered Edward's reign and was named after him, coincided with the start of a new century and heralded significant changes in technology and society, including steam turbine propulsion and the rise of socialism. He died in 1910 in the midst of a constitutional crisis that was resolved the following year by the Parliament Act 1911, which restricted the power of the unelected House of Lords.",

Later that day, Ubayd met the cheater and told him not to do it again. Unfortunately, Ubayd' s experience is not unusual. Whether it's kids copying class -mates' answers during tests or friends sharing homework, cheating happens in schools every day. Experts say the behavior starts in the lower grades. Surveys show that one in three elementary students admits to cheating. Jacob Harder, a fourth grader in Ware, Massachusetts, has had classmates ask to copy his homework. \"I wouldn't want to just tell them the answers,\" he says. So instead, he explains the task and encourages his classmates to do it themselves. But many kids find it hard to say no. \"l hear from kids all the time, ' I can' t say no to a friend,'\" says Eric Anderman, a professor at The Ohio State University who studies cheating in school. He says it' s important to say no from the start. \"Then you _ , and the other kid gets the message,\" he says. Plus, he points out, \"a real friend is not going to disown you because he or she couldn't copy your math homework.\" The kids doing the copying may feel they need to cheat to be accepted by other kids. And some students may cheat simply because others do. \"If you' re in an atmosphere where cheating is common, you may think that if you don' t cheat, you' re at a disadvantage,\" says Michael Josephson, founder of the Josephson Institute of Ethics. But Josephson says students shouldn't think that way. \"There are a lot of things kids do,\" he says. \"You have to decide what kind of person you' re going to be.\" When school becomes too challenging, Anderman suggests going to the teacher rather than relying on the work of others. \"It' s good to ask for help,\" he says.",

It has an area of nearly and its population is estimated at 1.5 million people. Its capital and largest city is Libreville. \n\nSince its independence from France in 1960, Gabon has had three presidents. In the early 1990s, Gabon introduced a multi-party system and a new democratic constitution that allowed for a more transparent electoral process and reformed many governmental institutions. Gabon was also a temporary member of the United Nations Security Council for the 2010\u20132011 term. \n\nAbundant petroleum and foreign private investment have helped make Gabon one of the most prosperous countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, with the 4th highest HDI and the third highest GDP per capita (PPP) (after Equatorial Guinea and Botswana) in the region. GDP grew by more than 6% per year from 2010 to 2012. However, because of inequality in income distribution, a significant proportion of the population remains poor. Gabon's name originates from \"gab\u00e3o\", Portuguese for \"cloak\", which is roughly the shape of the estuary of the Komo River by Libreville.",

I went to the show's website to see for myself. My mom was right. At a time when even Barbara Walters says she's really bored with celebrities interviews, this one will not disappoint. \n\nIt's the story of Derek Paravicini, a 30-year-old who was born three months early, physically disabled (he can't button his own shirt), blind, and severely autistic . \n\nYet, through total luck and coincidence, his family discovered that Derek had a remarkable musical talent when he was three. \n\nDerek can hear any musical composition one time and play it perfectly on the piano. \n\nThat's right. He only has to hear it once. \n\nEven more unbelievable, his brain, like a computer, can keep many songs that he can immediately repeat when asked. But his talent isn't limited to just learning things by heart. Derek is a true musical genius and artist who plays beautifully in a wide range of styles and can make his own music. \n\nWith his talent, Derek has raised millions of dollars putting on charity concerts. He also donates his time to senior centers where he acts as a human jukebox machine, taking requests from senior citizens who haven't heard their favorite songs for decades. \n\nAs it turns out, Derek loves people and his extraordinary talent has been the key to unlocking his personality and social development. \n\nIf you want to inspire your family, pop some popcorn and sit everyone down to watch this excellent piece of journalism. If your kids are like mine, it will cause a great family discussion about the definition of \"disability\" and the extraordinary ability of the human brain and spirit. It may even give you the perfect answer the next time your child says he or she \"can't\" do something. Now that's priceless. \n\nWho says there's nothing good on TV?",

Last year, almost 2 million watched it , more than 150,000 took part in it and they filled the streets. The parade, first held in 1776, is also one of the oldest. \n\nChicago also throws a big celebration. Every year, the Chicago River, which crosses the city, shines green as event organizers pour about 40 pounds of fluorescence, a powerful dye , into the water. \n\nBoston keeps its parade rolling for three hours or more. It is the nation's second-largest parade. The city will also show respect to one of its most famous former residents, President John F. Kennedy, by opening the exhibit \"A Journey Home:John F. Kennedy and Ireland\", at his official library. \n\nPatron Saint lived in Britain in the early fifth century, when it was still part of the Roman Empire. He was caught and sold into slavery in Ireland when he was only 16. He finally escaped slavery and turned to a life of religious devotion. He trained to become a minister and set out to spread Christianity throughout Ireland. After 30 years as a religious leader, Patrick died on March 17, 1461. Saint Patrick's Day is always celebrated on March 17. In Ireland, it is an official holiday.",

      "story": "British writer John Bunyan was born at Elstow, Bedfordshire, England, in November, 1628. His father was a maker and mender of pots and kettles, and the son followed the same trade. Though he is usually called a tinker, Bunyan had a settled home and place of business. He had little schooling, and he describes his early surroundings as poor and mean. He became much interested in religions, but it was only after a tremendous spiritual conflict, lasting three or four years, that he found peace. His struggles are related with extraordinary vividness and intensity in his \"Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners.\" His writing began with a controversy against the Quakers , and shows from the first the command of a homely but vigorous style. \n\nLike most working men at the time, Bunyan had a deep hatred for the corrupted, hypocritical rich who accumulated their wealth \"by hook and by crook.\" As a stout Puritan , he had made a conscientious study of the Bible and firmly believed in salvation through spiritual struggle. \n\nBunyan's style was modeled after that of the English Bible. With his concrete and living language and carefully observed and vividly presented details, he made it possible for the reader of the least education to share the pleasure of reading his novel and to relive the experience of his characters. \n\nBunyan's works include Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners (1666), The Life and Death of Mr. Badman (1680), The Holy War (1682) and The Pilgrim's Progress (1684). \n\nThe Pilgrim's Progress is the most successful religious allegory in the English language. Its purpose is to urge people to observe Christian doctrines and seek salvation through constant struggle with their own weaknesses and all kinds of social evils. It is not only about something spiritual but also bears much relevance to the time. Its predominant metaphor -- life as a journey -- is simple and familiar. The objects that Christian meets are homely and commonplace, and the scenes presented are typical English ones, but throughout the allegory a spiritual significance is added to the commonplace details. Here the strange is combined with the familiar and the trivial joined to the divine, and, a rich imagination and a natural talent for storytelling also contribute to the success of the work which is at once entertaining and morally instructive. \n\n\"The Vanity Fair,\" is an excerpt from The Pilgrim's Progress. The story starts with a dream in which the author sees Christian the Pilgrim, with a heavy burden on his back, reading the Bible. When he learns from the book that the city in which he and his family live shall be burnt down in a fire, Christian tries to convince his family and his neighbors of the oncoming disaster and asks them to go with him in search of salvation, but most of them simply ignore him. So he starts off with a friend, Pliable. Pliable turns back after they stumble into a pit, the Slough of Despond. Christian struggles on by himself. Then he is misled by Mr. Wordly Wiseman and is brought back onto the right road by Mr. Evangelist. There he joins Faithful, a neighbor who has set out later but has made better progress. The two go on together through many adventures, including the great struggle with Apollyon, who claims them to be his subjects and refuse to accept their allegiance to God. After many other adventures they come to the Vanity Fair where both are arrested as alien agitators. They are tried and Faithful is condemned to death. Christian, however manages to escape and goes on his way, assisted by a new friend, Hopeful. Tired of the hard journey, they are tempted to take pleasant path and are then captured by Giant Despair. Finally they get away and reach the Celestial City, where they enjoy eternal life in the fellowship of the blessed.",

      "story": "In Judaism, a rabbi is a teacher of Torah. This title derives from the Hebrew word ' , meaning \"My Master\" (irregular plural ' ), which is the way a student would address a master of Torah. The word \"master\" \"\" literally means \"great one\". \n\nThe basic form of the rabbi developed in the Pharisaic and Talmudic era, when learned teachers assembled to codify Judaism's written and oral laws. The first sage for whom the Mishnah uses the title of rabbi was Yohanan ben Zakkai, active in the early to mid first century CE. In more recent centuries, the duties of a rabbi became increasingly influenced by the duties of the Protestant Christian minister, hence the title \"pulpit rabbis\", and in 19th-century Germany and the United States rabbinic activities including sermons, pastoral counseling, and representing the community to the outside, all increased in importance. \n\nWithin the various Jewish denominations there are different requirements for rabbinic ordination, and differences in opinion regarding who is to be recognized as a rabbi. For example, Orthodox Judaism does not ordain women as rabbis, but other movements have chosen to do so for halakhic reasons (Conservative Judaism) as well as ethical reasons (Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism).",

Her husband's name was Henry. Henry was a very good farmer. He grew tomatoes. His neighbor grew corn, potatoes, and bananas. His neighbor's name was David. David had a son named James who played in Henry's field. One day James fell and Henry almost ran him over with his horse. It was very scary. James was very careful when playing in the field.

      "story": "Starting from this month, you won't be hearing the word \"NBA\" on sports programs on CCTV. Instead, sport hosts will give the full Chinese name when they refer to the NBA - National Basketball Association. You also won't hear any other English abbreviations on CCTV's Chinese programs, such as GDP (gross domestic product) or WTO (World Trade Organization). You will hear their Chinese translations. CCTV received a notice from the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, telling it to avoid using English-language abbreviations in their reports to protect the \"purity\" of the Chinese language. A few other TV stations also received the notice. Fu Zhenguo, an editor of People's Daily, is one of the people who proposed the change. \"Using English in a Chinese-speaking environment is against Chinese law,\" he said. \"Using English on Chinese TV programs is unfair to people who don't understand English. It will have a bad language influence on kids and teenagers.\" But some experts have a different opinion. Liu Yaoying, a professor at the Communications University of China, said the move shows cultural conservatism . \"If Western countries can accept some Chinglish words, why can't the Chinese language be mixed with English?\" Liu said. A lot of people have criticized the move, saying that it will cause problems for them. \"I understand what CD, VCD and DVD mean when I hear them. But I won't know what the TV programs are talking about if I hear those products' full Chinese names,\" a person wrote in a BBS post. Following the same post, another person wrote jokingly: \"I'm not listening to my MP3 now. I'm listening to my Moving Picture Experts Group-1 Audio Layer 3. Some people also question why CCTV is keeping its logo, since it is also an English abbreviation.",

She now shrank back against this wall, as if she were trying to get through it. The edge of the portrait's frame tilted her hat out of the straight, but in this supreme moment she did not even notice it. \n\n\"Er--how do you do?\" she said. \n\nIf she had not been an exceedingly pretty girl, one would have said that she spoke squeakily. The fighting spirit of the Bennetts, though it was considerable fighting spirit, had not risen to this emergency. It had ebbed out of her, leaving in its place a cold panic. She had seen this sort of thing in the movies--there was one series of pictures, \"The Dangers of Diana,\" where something of the kind had happened to the heroine in every reel--but she had not anticipated that it would ever happen to her; and consequently she had not thought out any plan for coping with such a situation. A grave error. In this world one should be prepared for everything, or where is one? \n\n\"I've brought the revolver,\" said Mr. Peters. \n\n\"So--so I see!\" said Billie. \n\nMr. Peters nursed the weapon affectionately in his hand. He was rather a shy man with women as a rule, but what Sam had told him about her being interested in his revolver had made his heart warm to this girl. ",

Then he made his way down into the shabby hall and was seated there on the worn settee when his guest descended. She was wearing a hat which, so far as he could judge, was almost becoming. Her gloves, notwithstanding their many signs of mending, were neat, her shoes carefully polished, and although her dress was undeniably shabby, there was something in her carriage which pleased him. Her eyes were fixed upon his from the moment she stepped from the lift. She was watching for his expression half defiantly, half anxiously. \n\n\"Well, you see what I look like,\" she remarked brusquely. \"You can back out of it, if you want to.\" \n\n\"Don't be silly,\" he replied. \"You look quite all right. I'm not much of a beau myself, you know. I bought this suit over the counter the other day, without being measured for it or anything.\" \n\n\"Guess you ain't used to ready-made clothes,\" she observed, as they stepped outside. \n\n\"You see, in England--and the Colonies,\" he added hastily, \"things aren't so expensive as here. What a wonderful city this is of yours, Martha!\" \n\n\"Miss Grimes, please,\" she corrected him. \n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he apologised. \n\n\"That's just what I was afraid of,\" she went on querulously. \"You're beginning already. You think because you're giving me a meal, you can take all sorts of liberties.

It was too expensive for my family, and I always carried my lunch and took the bag back home to use it again the next day. So you could understand my happiness when I had the chance to buy a hot lunch. When we finished lunch that day, Mrs Elise took me aside and said she wanted to explain why she had bought my sandwich. I really didn't care why, but it gave me a few minutes of her special attention, so I was quiet as she explained. She told me that she was a Catholic and Catholics didn't eat red meat on Fridays, they ate fish on Fridays. Oh, I couldn't wait to get home and tell my mother that from then on I wanted a tuna fish sandwich on Fridays. After my mother understood why, she gladly made tuna fish sandwiches for me on Fridays. She even made it with brown bread because she knew Mrs Elise liked brown bread. From then on, every Friday I could get in line with other kids for a hot lunch. I didn't care how many of the kids complained about cafeteria food. It tasted _ to me! I realize now that Mrs Elise could have made herself tuna fish sandwiches on Fridays. But she bought mine because she saw a little girl who was excited at the simple act of having a hot lunch.

Rooms were given me in the palace, also, through which I passed at night to the high watch-tower, whence I looked on the stars and drew their auguries. For at this time Cleopatra was much troubled about matters political, and not knowing how the great struggle among the Roman factions would end, but being very desirous to side with the strongest, she took constant counsel with me as to the warnings of the stars. These I read to her in such manner as best seemed to fit the high interest of my ends. For Antony, the Roman Triumvir, was now in Asia Minor, and, rumour ran, very wroth because it had been told him that Cleopatra was hostile to the Triumvirate, in that her General, Serapion, had aided Cassius. But Cleopatra protested loudly to me and others that Serapion had acted against her will. Yet Charmion told me that, as with Allienus, it was because of a prophecy of Dioscorides the unlucky that the Queen herself had secretly ordered Serapion so to do. Still, this did not save Serapion, for to prove to Antony that she was innocent she dragged the General from the sanctuary and slew him. Woe be to those who carry out the will of tyrants if the scale should rise against them! And so Serapion perished. ",

But once you were there, I found, you were in. \n\nGlobe jobs were for life-guaranteed until retirement. For 15 years I had prospered there--moving from an ordinary reporter to senior editor. I would have a lifetime of security if I stuck with it. Instead, I had made a decision to leave. I entered my boss's office. Would he be angry? I wondered. He had a famous temper. \"Matt, we have to have a talk,\" I began. \"I came to the Globe when I was twenty-four. Now I' m forty. There' s a lot I want to do in life. I'm resigning. \" \"To another paper?\" he asked. I reached into my coat pocket, but didn't say anything. I handed him a letter that explained everything. It said that I was leaving to start a new media company. We were at a rare turning point in history. I wanted to be directly engaged in the change. \"I' m glad for you,\" he said, quite out of my expectation. \"I just came from a board of directors meeting and it was seventy-five percent discouraging news. Some of that we can deal with. But much of it we can' t,\" he went on. \"I wish you all the luck in the world,\" he concluded. \"And if it doesn't work out, remember, there is always a place here for you.\" \n\nThen I went out of his office, walking through the newsroom for more good-byes. Everybody was saying congratulations. Everybody--even though I'd be risking all the financial security I had carefully built up. \n\nLater, I had a final talk with Bill Taylor, chairman and publisher of the Boston Globe. He had turned the Globe into a billion-dollar property. \"I' m resigning, Bill,\" I said. He listened while I gave him the story. He wasn't looking angry either.

The guide claims, \"Martin Luther King visited his supporters in Liverpool three times, and the first draft of his famous speech 'I Have a Dream' is claimed to have been written at Adelphi Hotel.\" The speech, delivered to civil rights campaigners on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington in 1963, is one of the most quoted texts in history and was a definitive moment in the American Civil Rights Movement and in the fight for racial equality. \n\nDr. King's biographer, Godfrey Hodgson, said that the suggestion did not fit the facts. He said, \"I don't believe it. If he had been to Liverpool, there would have been massive media reports, as he would have been a big figure by then. Dr. King did visit the UK on a number of occasions but he was not in the UK around the time of this famous speech in 1963.\"Prof. John Belcham, a history lecturer of University of Liverpool who wrote an 800year history of Liverpool in 2008, confirmed that he was unaware of any connection between Dr. King and the city.",

Much of the West is marking the anniversary with new translations of the author's works, including War and Peace. Movies are being released, including a black-and-white documentary and a feature film. In short, everyone is celebrating. Everyone, that is, except for people in Tolstoy's home country, Russia. \n\nThe English newspaper the Guardian reports that the Russian government has scheduled nothing for November, the official anniversary of Tolstoy's death. The quiet is amazing, considering the importance of this man's contribution to global culture. \n\n\"Across the whole world there is a huge Tolstoy boom ,\" Andrei Deryabin, co-producer of a new film about the author's final days titled The Last Station, told the Guardian. \"He's esteemed everywhere apart from here in Russia.\" \n\nExperts explain the government's silence in various ways. Some refer to Tolstoy's disagreement with state-backed religion. Tolstoy's Christian views often _ those of the Roman Catholic church. \n\nHis great grandson, Vladimir Ilyich Tolstoy, thinks Russia's cool attitude has more to do with history and the author's positive worldview. After all, the last century was a difficult one of the country's people. The darker writings of Fyodor Dostoevsky, he says, better fit the national character. Tolstoy hopes that as Russians grow more optimistic they will rediscover one of their own national treasures. \n\n\"Tolstoy gives positive answers to the questions mankind is asking,\" he told the Guardian. \" In this sense he gives more hope. I hope the 21stcentury is Tolstoyan.\"",

It was really a very good newspaper, if small in size, and related the news of the day as promptly as the great New York journals did. \n\nArthur Weldon had not been very enthusiastic about the paper at any time, although he humored the girls by attending in a good-natured way to the advertising, hiring some of the country folk to get subscriptions, and keeping the books. He was a young man of considerable education who had inherited a large fortune, safely invested, and therefore had no need, through financial necessity, to interest himself in business of any sort. He allowed the girls to print his name as editor in chief, but he did no editorial work at all, amusing himself these delightful summer days by wandering in the woods, where he collected botanical specimens, or sitting with Uncle John on the lawn, where they read together or played chess. Both the men were glad the girls were happy in their work and enthusiastic over the success of their audacious venture. Beth was developing decided talent as a writer of editorials and her articles were even more thoughtful and dignified than were those of Patsy. The two girls found plenty to occupy them at the office, while Louise did the reportorial work and flitted through Millville and down to Huntingdon each day in search of small items of local interest. She grew fond of this work, for it brought her close to the people and enabled her to study their characters and peculiarities. Her manner of approaching the simple country folk was so gracious and winning that they freely gave her any information they possessed, and chatted with her unreservedly. ",

She went into a store and asked, \"Do you have cold drinks? \"The woman there didn't say anything. Lisa repeated the question. Still the woman said nothing. She later learned that the woman had answered her: She had raised her eyebrows , which in Micronesia means\"yes\". Jan remembered an experience she had in Bulgaria, a country in Europe. She went to a restaurant that was known for its cabbage. She asked the waiter, \"Do you have cabbage today? \"He nodded his head. Jan waited, but the cabbage never came. In that country, a nod means\"no\". Tom had a similar problem when he arrived in India. After explaining something in class, he asked his students if they understood. They answered with many different nods and shakes of the head. He thought some people had not understood, so he explained again. When he asked again, they did the same thing.

      "story": "CHAPTER I. \n\n\"Nerei repandirostrum incurvicervicum pecus.\" \n\nA dingy, swashy, splashy afternoon in October; a school-yard filled with a mob of riotous boys. A lot of us standing outside. \n\nSuddenly came a dull, crashing sound from the school-room. At the ominous interruption I shuddered involuntarily, and called to Smithsye:-- \n\n\"What's up, Smithums?\" \n\n\"Guy's cleaning out the fourth form,\" he replied. \n\nAt the same moment George de Coverly passed me, holding his nose, from whence the bright Norman blood streamed redly. To him the plebeian Smithsye laughingly:-- \n\n\"Cully! how's his nibs?\" \n\nI pushed the door of the school-room open. There are some spectacles which a man never forgets. The burning of Troy probably seemed a large-sized conflagration to the pious Aeneas, and made an impression on him which he carried away with the feeble Anchises. \n\nIn the centre of the room, lightly brandishing the piston-rod of a steam-engine, stood Guy Heavystone alone. I say alone, for the pile of small boys on the floor in the corner could hardly be called company. \n\nI will try and sketch him for the reader. Guy Heavystone was then only fifteen. His broad, deep chest, his sinewy and quivering flank, his straight pastern, showed him to be a thoroughbred. Perhaps he was a trifle heavy in the fetlock, but he held his head haughtily erect. His eyes were glittering but pitiless. There was a sternness about the lower part of his face,--the old Heavystone look,--a sternness, heightened, perhaps, by the snaffle-bit which, in one of his strange freaks, he wore in his mouth to curb his occasional ferocity. His dress was well adapted to his square-set and herculean frame. A striped knit undershirt, close-fitting striped tights, and a few spangles set off his figure; a neat Glengarry cap adorned his head. On it was displayed the Heavystone crest, a cock regardant on a dunghill or, and the motto, \"Devil a better!\" ",

      "story": "One day there was a six year old little girl named Megan who lived in a big house with her family. She had two dogs, a brother, a sister, and a mom and dad. Every day she woke up and went to kindergarten, played outside, and watched movies. Sometimes her family would go to a rollercoaster park. Her mom would always try to get her to ride the big rides but she was afraid and wanted to stay in Snoopyland. For two years she stayed in the little kid section of the park. Her big brother who had to babysit her was getting mad because she would not try new rides. She cried more and more until one day she got brave. She went on a little bigger musical ride that went around in circles pretty fast. She got off the ride and loved it! Her mom said to her, \"Okay, let's go on the big kid rides now!\" Megan was afraid again and cried and cried. For the rest of that summer she stayed in the little kid section and went on little rides. The next summer her brother brought his girlfriend home. His girlfriend's name was Sara and she was older, and loved big rides. Megan liked Sara a lot and wanted to make her like her. When Sara asked Megan if she would ride on bigger rides she said yes, and she went on her first real rollercoaster, Thunderhawk. She was frightened at first but when she stepped off the ride she loved it like she had loved the other ride last year! Now was the real test. Sara asked Megan if she wanted to go on the biggest ride in the park. She was afraid but wanted to show Sara how big she was. At the beginning of the ride Megan was afraid and was about to start crying when they went down the first big hill. Her stomach was tickled and she began laughing really loud. She stepped off the ride with a huge smile on her face and was very proud. Megan was no longer afraid of the big rides and enjoyed riding them for the rest of her life.",

My grandfather was sitting in the backyard, reading. \"Hey, you look like you need some fun,\" he said. \"Want to go fishing?\" I said sure, and he went to the garage. He came out with two poles, some hooks, and some fishing line. Everything was in pieces, but he showed me how to put it all together. I asked if we needed worms, and he said no. Then, we set off to the river. \n\nIt was only about ten blocks to the river, but walking along past the library and the store, he told me about how he used to go fishing with his friend Steve. They used to catch catfish, then take them home so that their mothers could cook them for dinner. When we got to the park at the river, my grandfather went right to the bank, then turned and walked up along the side of the river until we were off in the shade under the trees right at the edge of the park. There, he taught me how to throw my line in the water. Then we sat down to wait. While we were fishing, my grandfather told me lots of stories about what he and Steve did as kids. We didn't have any worms, so we never caught any fish, but sitting there as he told me stories made it a great afternoon.",

Poultry also includes other birds that are killed for their meat, such as the young of pigeons (known as squabs) but does not include similar wild birds hunted for sport or food and known as game.

She also is accused of stealing her victims' belongings. \n\nHer attorney, Mark Howard, said his client \"categorically denies that she committed any acts of genocide, or committed any crimes, as the prosecution alleges here.\" ",

Jeff Cotner said reporters, nor do they believe he knew Al-Jumaili's ethnicity. \n\nAnd they haven't given any indication Al-Jumaili had anything to do with what led the teen to head out armed in the first place -- a purported shooting at his girlfriend's apartment, if that in fact happened. Cotner said that, while there have nearby shootings that might be tied to gangs, \"we (have been) unable to substantiate ... whether or not there was an actual shooting at the apartment.\" \n\nWhat police do believe, based on witness testimony and other evidence, is that the teenager shot and killed Al-Jumaili, for whatever reason. \n\n\"When he saw Mr. Al-Jumaili and their family, he targeted them, he shot at them with intent,\" Cotner said of the suspect, who is under arrest. \"And as Mr. Al-Jumaili ran back toward his apartment, he tracked him with his rifle and continued to fire.\" \n\nDallas police named the suspected shooter, though CNN is not identifying him yet since he's a minor and it's not clear if he'll be charged as an adult.

Faye Wong and her husband Li Yapeng started the Yan Ran Angel Foundation for harelipped children three years ago. It was named after their daughter. Its purpose is to help children under 14 to cure their harelips. The couple donated one million yuan (about $ 133,000) to start the organization. Cong Fei was born in a poor family. He became a successful singer in Shenzhen. He helped 178 poor students and disabled people for more than 10 years. Before he died of an illness at the age of 37 in 2006, he decided to donate his cornea to people with eye problems. He helped six people see the world. Guan Mucun has donated money to Project Hope to help poor students finish primary education. Thirty of these poor students have already finished high school with her support. Guan has also helped with charity work for environment protection, HIV/AIDS prevention, blood donation and \"Mother Water\". Guan had an unlucky childhood: her mother died when she was only 10 years old. With the help of the government and her neighbours, she grew up and was successful as a famous singer. Action star Jackie Chan is a wholehearted supporter of charities including UNICEF, Operation Smile and his own Jackie Chan Charitable Foundation. In 2007, he used much of his spare time to visit the farthest parts of China on his Dragon's Heart Charity Missions. The Dragon's Heart Foundation aims to meet the needs of poor children and the elderly in the hardest-to-reach areas of the country. Chan has made several trips to these poor villages, bringing warm clothing, wheelchairs and school supplies, and helping to build schools.",

The \u00d8resund Bridge connects the two cities by rail and road. \n\nOriginally a Viking fishing village founded in the 10th century, Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century. Beginning in the 17th century it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions, defences and armed forces. After suffering from the effects of plague and fire in the 18th century, the city underwent a period of redevelopment. This included construction of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden and founding of such cultural institutions as the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. After further disasters in the early 19th century when Nelson attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city, rebuilding during the Danish Golden Age brought a Neoclassical look to Copenhagen's architecture. Later, following the Second World War, the Finger Plan fostered the development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre.",

      "story": "In an ecosystem, predation is a biological interaction where a predator (an organism that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked). Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey's tissue through consumption. Thus predation is often, though not always, carnivory. Other categories of consumption are herbivory (eating parts of plants), fungivory (eating parts of fungi), and detritivory (the consumption of dead organic material (detritus)). All these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer-resource systems. It can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors. For example, some parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live in or on its decaying corpse after it has died. The key characteristic of predation however is the predator's direct impact on the prey population. On the other hand, detritivores simply eat dead organic material arising from the decay of dead individuals and have no direct impact on the \"donor\" organism(s).",

By 2018, 143,000 additional students will enter the already crowded public-education system. Gerner needs 73 new schools to house them. Four architecture teams have nearly finished designing primary school prototypes ; they plan to construct their schools starting in 2009. The district will then assess how well the schools perform, and three winners will copy those designs in 50 to 70 new buildings. \n\nGreen schools are appearing all over, but in Clark County, which stands out for its vastness, such aggressive targets are difficult because design requirements like more natural light for students go against the realities of a desert climate. \"One of the biggest challenges is getting the right site orientation ,\" Mark. McGinty, a director at SH Architecture, says. His firm recently completed a high school in Las Vegas. \"You have the same building, same set of windows, but if its orientation is incorrect and it faces the sun, it will be really expensive to cool.\" \n\nSurprisingly, the man responsible for one of re most progressive green-design competitions has doubts about ideas of eco-friendly buildings. \"I don't believe in the new green religion,\" Gerner says. \"Some of the building technologies that you get are impractical.

      "story": "The world produces about 4 billion metric tons of food a year but 1.2 to 2 billion tons is not eaten, the study by the London-based Institution of Mechanical Engineers said. It is instead thrown away. Experts say food is wasted in both rich and poor countries, but for different reasons. \n\nElliot Woolley teaches sustainable manufacturing at Loughborough University in Britain. He spoke at the Global Conference on Sustainable Manufacturing, which was held earlier this month in Vietnam. \n\nMr. Woolley said in poor countries, food is usually lost while it is still in the field or during storage and transportation. He said that is because food producers there are inefficient. These businesses are unable to operate effectively without wasting materials, time or energy. But he added that once food is sold in developing countries, people usually eat everything they buy. \n\nHowever, people in developed countries throw away as much as half of the food they purchase. In the US, big contributors to waste include supersized portions that customers simply can't manage, and\"eat as much as you want\"offers in restaurants. In the UK, over-conservative sell-by dates on labels and two-for-one offers of perishable items are key factors, encouraging consumers to buy too much food to start with and to throw away items that have reached their sell-by date, but which are still edible. And efficient farming methods, transport and storage mean that most of the wastage occurs through retail and customer behavior. The British researcher called this custom\"adisgrace\". \n\nElliot Woolley has created a smartphone app that he says shows users what food they have bought and when the food is about to become unsafe to eat. It also gives information on how people can combine the foods they have to make a meal. The software program is called\"Pantry App\". \n\nMr. Woolley said that people who used the app reduced the amount of food they wasted by a third. But this result came from a limited experiment -- users only followed their food use for a week. \n\nJeremy Bonvoisin is a student at the Technical University of Berlin. He attended the recent conference in Vietnam. He said one way to solve the problem of wasting food is to take steps to persuade people to stop buying so much food in the first place. He said people buy more food than they need because it is becoming less costly. They waste so much food because they buy more than they need. \n\nHe said the new app could help those who already want to change the way they use the food they buy. But he is also worried that it could get people to waste more food because they no longer have to pay attention to how much they have bought.",

      "story": "(CNN) -- The ouster of Tunisia's longtime ruler has cast a shadow over the surrounding region, but few analysts were willing to predict Tuesday that the revolt would spread to other countries. \n\nZine El Abidine Ben Ali was Tunisia's president for 23 years before Friday, when weeks of protests forced him into exile in Saudi Arabia. Tunisians complained that the president's family and supporters had grown rich while their living conditions stagnated and their voices were stifled. \n\nBut while the governments of nearby nations like Algeria, Libya and Egypt face similar criticism, the level of repression and the concentration of power and corruption were far more extreme in Tunisia, said Nathan Brown, a professor of Middle Eastern politics at George Washington University in Washington. \n\n\"I think most regimes in the region are viewed with a mix of disdain and resignation by their population,\" Brown said. Few may support their government, but \"It's not as if there's much that can be done about it,\" he said. \n\nNeighboring Algeria was also wracked by rioting last week, triggered by the spiraling costs of basic food items after its government slashed price supports for staples like milk, oil and sugar. State-run media reported at least three people had died in the clashes. \n\nLibya's longtime strongman, Moammar Gadhafi, mourned Ben Ali's ouster and warned in a nationally televised speech that Tunisia was facing \"unjustified chaos.\" And in Egypt, at least two people have set themselves afire in public this week -- the same type of protest that triggered Tunisia's demonstrations in December.

One of his specialties? Trout with braised leeks . \n\nNow 13, the young chef is being praised as a \"food prodigy \". He will spend his summer apprenticing with some of the best chefs at LA's famous restaurants, MSNBC Nightly New reports. \n\nMc Garry began making a name for himself in the culinary world when John Sedlar, owner of the trendy Playa Restaurant, let Mc Garry take over the kitchen for a special nine-course meal. The meal sold out almost instantly. \n\n\"Flynn is a very unusual young man, and he's very, very passionate,\" owner John Sedlar told MSNBC. \n\nBy usual teenage boy standards, it's true. So strong is his passion for cooking that the young man has turned his bedroom into an experimental kitchen laboratory. \n\nInstead of video game consoles, baseball trophies and movie posters, Mc Garry's room is lined with mixers, pots and pans, cutting boards and a stainless steel worktable. It's where Mc Garry cooks his monthly pop-up dinners, which are served from his family's dining room, a monthly supper club he calls Eureka. \n\nMc Garry is deft and confident in the kitchen, with skills he's been practicing since he was a child. What started out as a means of self-preservation from his mom's unsatisfactory cooking has turned into a passion that the teen hopes to develop into a career. \n\n\"My goal? Michelin three stars, a restaurant in the top 50 list,\" he told MSNBC. \"Hopefully the top five.\" Meanwhile, Mc Garry's 13-year-old resume is already richer and more impressive than most cooks many times his age. \n\nMc Garry isn't the only talented young prodigy to surprise experts in his field in recent years. At just 17 years old, physicist Taylor Wilson is already teaching graduate-level courses in physics and has built a functioning nuclear reactor.",

His humanity became apparent Monday, when the Vatican announced he'd resign at month's end \"because of advanced age,\" becoming the first pope in nearly 600 years to do so. \n\nAfter his birth on April 16, 1927, in Marktl am Inn, in southeastern Germany near the Austrian border, Ratzinger's early years were defined by his country and the turbulent times, as well as his faith. \n\nAdolf Hitler rose to power during Ratzinger's adolescent years in Traunstein, in the heavily Catholic region of Bavaria. When he was 14, school officials followed Nazi officials' orders and enrolled him and the rest of his class in the Hitler Youth movement -- against his will, Ratzinger wrote in his memoir. \n\nHe left the organization shortly thereafter, because he was studying for the priesthood. But in 1943, Ratzinger was brought back into the Nazi fold upon being drafted into the German army. \n\nFor the next two years, Ratzinger served his country as part of an anti-aircraft unit. But in the waning days of World War II, he deserted -- and was taken prisoner by the U.S. Army. ",

I stared across the table, where Olivia was sitting.'Get up there!' she whispered commandingly,\" Fontaine said.\"All the dislike we'd felt toward each other as children...all came rushing back in quickly changing pictures...I felt Olivia would spring across the table and seize me by the hair.\" \n\nOlivia did not win her first Oscar until 1946, for her role as the lover of a World War I pilot in Leisen's \" To Each His Own\". Fontaine later made it known that her. sister had slighted her as she attempted to offer congratulations.\"She took one look at me, ignored my hand, seized her Oscar and wheeled away,\" she said. \n\nThe sisters were also reportedly competitors in love. Howard Hughes, a strange businessman who dated the elder de Havilland for a time, offered marriage to Fontaine several times.\"I married first, won the Oscar before Olivia did, and if I die first, she'll undoubtedly be extremely angry because I beat her to it!\" Fontaine once joked. \n\nAs her film career fruited in the 1950s, Fontaine turned to television and dinner theatre, and also appeared in several Broadway productions, including the Lion in Winter\". Anything but the ordinary lady, Fontaine was also a licensed pilot, a champion balloonist, an accomplished golfer, a licensed .decoration designer and a first-class cook.",

For the Demiraj family, they believe it will mean great harm, even death, for those deported. \n\nA decade ago, Edmond Demiraj (pronounced: dem-EAR-eye) was himself an illegal immigrant. He told CNN he had walked across the U.S. border from Mexico to Brownsville, Texas without any paperwork. He found work as a painter, he says, with a fellow Albanian named Bill Bedini. \n\nNot long afterwards, the Justice Department indicted Bedini, accusing him and others of running a human smuggling ring, bringing illegal aliens from Mexico into the United States. Demiraj was named in the original indictment but charges against him were later dropped. \n\nAttorneys for the Justice Department based in Houston wanted Demiraj to testify against Bedini. In exchange, Demiraj told CNN that prosecutors promised him and his family protection and promised him a Green Card, which would lead to citizenship. The offer, he says, was verbal and not on paper. \n\n\"I'm ready to work for the U.S. government, whatever they need from me,\" Demiraj told CNN. \n\nBut Bedini entered a plea of not guilty, was granted bail and soon fled to Albania, according to the U.S. Marshal's office in Houston. Federal prosecutors didn't need Demiraj's testimony and handed him over to immigration officials, who quickly deported him as well. ",

Upon closer inspection of it, however, he came to realize--as Richard had realized earlier--that it was double-edged, and that the wielding of it must be fraught with as much danger for Richard as for their common enemy. For to betray Mr. Wilding and the plot would scarce be possible without betraying young Westmacott, and that was unthinkable, since to ruin Richard--a thing he would have done with a light heart so far as Richard was himself concerned--would be to ruin his own hopes of winning Ruth. \n\nTherefore, during the days that followed, Sir Rowland was forced to fret in idleness what time his wound was healing; but if his arm was invalided, his eyes and ears were sound, and he remained watchful for an opportunity to apply the knowledge he had gained. Richard mentioned the subject no more, so that Blake almost came to wonder whether the boy remembered what in his cups he had betrayed. \n\nMeanwhile Mr. Wilding moved serene and smiling on his way. Daily there were great armfuls of flowers deposited at Lupton House--his lover's offering to his mistress--and no day went by but that some richer gift accompanied them. Now it was a collar of brilliants, anon a rope of pearls, again a priceless ring that had been Mr. Wilding's mother's. Ruth received with reluctance these pledges of his undesired affection. It were idle to reject them, considering that she was to marry him; yet it hurt her sorely to retain them. On her side she made no dispositions for the marriage, but went about her daily tasks as though she were to remain a maid at Lupton House for a time as yet indefinite. ",

      "story": "American sign language has an interesting history. Although there have always been deaf individuals in America, the history really begins in 1817. Before 1817 deaf people communicated by using \"home signs\". Gestures were individually created and used within the home for simple communication. There were no schools or formal sign language training for the deaf. \n\nSo, why was 1817 an important date? Well, the story begins with Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet. Gallaudet met his neighbor's daughter Alice Cogswell. Alice was the young deaf daughter of Dr. Mason Cogswell from Hartford, Connecticut. Gallaudet began teaching Alice to read and write a few simple words. Excited by the success Dr. Cogswell encouraged Gallaudet to establish a school for the deaf. Cogswell raised the money and Gallaudet traveled to Britain to learn the methods used there. However, the schools refused to share their instructional techniques and methods. \n\nWhile in London, there happened to be a demonstration of the French method of deaf education. Britain was using an oral method of instruction; however, the French method used signs. Gallaudet was fascinated with the method and was able to meet with the instructor, Sicard, and his two deaf pupils, Jean Massieu and Laurent Clerc. Sicard agreed to teach Gallaudet his method and Gallaudet went to Paris to learn French signs. After a while, Gallaudet wished to return home and convinced Clerc to go with him and help him establish the school. The trip home was a 52-day voyage during which Clerc taught Gallaudet French signs and Gallaudet taught Clerc English. \n\nOn April 15, 1817, Laurent Clerc and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet established what is currently known as the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut. The opening of the first school for the deaf can be viewed as one of the most important events in current deaf culture.",

      "story": "American sign language has an interesting history. Although there have always been deaf individuals in America, the history really begins in 1817. Before 1817 deaf people communicated by using \"home signs\". Gestures were individually created and used within the home for simple communication. There were no schools or formal sign language training for the deaf. \n\nSo, why was 1817 an important date? Well, the story begins with Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet. Gallaudet met his neighbor's daughter Alice Cogswell. Alice was the young deaf daughter of Dr. Mason Cogswell from Hartford, Connecticut. Gallaudet began teaching Alice to read and write a few simple words. Excited by the success Dr. Cogswell encouraged Gallaudet to establish a school for the deaf. Cogswell raised the money and Gallaudet traveled to Britain to learn the methods used there. However, the schools refused to share their instructional techniques and methods. \n\nWhile in London, there happened to be a demonstration of the French method of deaf education. Britain was using an oral method of instruction; however, the French method used signs. Gallaudet was fascinated with the method and was able to meet with the instructor, Sicard, and his two deaf pupils, Jean Massieu and Laurent Clerc. Sicard agreed to teach Gallaudet his method and Gallaudet went to Paris to learn French signs. After a while, Gallaudet wished to return home and convinced Clerc to go with him and help him establish the school. The trip home was a 52-day voyage during which Clerc taught Gallaudet French signs and Gallaudet taught Clerc English. \n\nOn April 15, 1817, Laurent Clerc and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet established what is currently known as the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut. The opening of the first school for the deaf can be viewed as one of the most important events in current deaf culture.",

Art Deco influenced the design of buildings, furniture, jewellery, fashion, cars, movie theatres, trains, ocean liners, and everyday objects such as radios and vacuum cleaners. It took its name, short for \"Arts D\u00e9coratifs\", from the Exposition Internationale des Arts D\u00e9coratifs et Industriels Modernes (International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts) held in Paris in 1925. It combined modernist styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials. During its heyday, Art Deco represented luxury, glamour, exuberance, and faith in social and technological progress. \n\nArt Deco was a pastiche of many different styles, sometimes contradictory, united by a desire to be modern. From its outset, Art Deco was influenced by the bold geometric forms of Cubism; the bright colors of Fauvism and of the Ballets Russes; the updated craftsmanship of the furniture of the eras of Louis Philippe and Louis XVI; and the exotic styles of China and Japan, India, Persia, ancient Egypt and Maya art. It featured rare and expensive materials, such as ebony and ivory, and exquisite craftsmanship. The Chrysler Building and other skyscrapers of New York built during the 1920s and 1930s are monuments of the Art Deco style.",

The Coast Guard is a maritime, military, multi-mission service unique among the U.S. military branches for having a maritime law enforcement mission (with jurisdiction in both domestic and international waters) and a federal regulatory agency mission as part of its mission set. It operates under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during peacetime, and can be transferred to the U.S. Department of the Navy by the U.S. President at any time, or by the U.S. Congress during times of war. This has happened twice, in 1917, during World War I, and in 1941, during World War II. \n\nCreated by Congress on 4 August 1790 at the request of Alexander Hamilton as the Revenue Marine, it is the oldest continuous seagoing service of the United States. As Secretary of the Treasury, Hamilton headed the Revenue Marine, whose original purpose was collecting customs duties in the nation's seaports. By the 1860s, the service was known as the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and the term Revenue Marine gradually fell into disuse. \n\nThe modern Coast Guard was formed by a merger of the Revenue Cutter Service and the U.S. Life-Saving Service on 28 January 1915, under the U.S. Department of the Treasury. As one of the country's five armed services, the Coast Guard has been involved in every U.S. war from 1790 to the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan. the Coast Guard had over 36,000 men and women on active duty, 7,350 reservists, 29,620 auxiliarists, and 7,064 full-time civilian employees. In terms of size, the U.S. Coast Guard by itself is the world's 12th largest naval force.",

The big topsail swayed across it, blotting out the stars, and there was a rhythmic splashing beneath the bows. \n\nAnthea Merril stood at the tiller outlined against the heave of sea, for the night was warm and she was dressed in white.

      "story": "The story of the day I lost my best friend to a car accident. The day a precious life was taken from us way too soon. \n\nIt was a bright and Sunny day in November. Thanksgiving had been celebrated only two days before. Since it was a holiday weekend I had been on the phone with Greg the night before many times. His dad didn't want him to come over because of the holiday. I guess he finally wore him down and he called and said, \"I can stay\". So, my mom, brother, and I went to pick him up. He was always smiling. The complete opposite of my shy self, Greg was always the life of the party. \n\nWe got two large pizzas that Friday night. I've never known anyone in my entire life who loved to eat more than Greg. That's the way he was though. He was just enjoying life. And if it meant gaining weight or whatever, so be it. He would sit back and put his hands on his belly and just laugh. We (Greg, David, and I) did so many funny things together and had such great times. Things we should have done and things we shouldn't have done, I'll \"Never\" forget. \n\nOn Saturday morning Dad took us out for breakfast. We all finished eating and followed my Dad up to the cashier. Greg asked Dad if he could have a candy bar. I looked at Greg shaking my head. He just laughed. After breakfast, Father took us to my Mom's house. \n\nWhen we got out at Mom's house there was no one home. So, one of us grabbed a big wheel and rode it down the steep driveway into the street. Just boys being boys. Greg and I did it several times until the last time. The car hit him on the head, knocking him around 75-- 100 yards. My brother and I both ran screaming just yelling for help and crying. One of the neighbors called 911. I was in shock. That day was forever etched into our memories. \n\nIt still hurts to think about it. Wishing we could have grown old together. Wondering how it would have been. I'm sure It WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT.",

      "story": "The term Carnival is traditionally used in areas with a large Catholic presence. However, the Philippines, a predominantly Roman Catholic country, does not celebrate Carnival anymore since the dissolution of the Manila Carnival after 1939, the last carnival in the country. In historically Lutheran countries, the celebration is known as Fastelavn, and in areas with a high concentration of Anglicans and Methodists, pre-Lenten celebrations, along with penitential observances, occur on Shrove Tuesday. In Eastern Orthodox nations, Maslenitsa is celebrated during the last week before Great Lent. In German-speaking Europe and the Netherlands, the Carnival season traditionally opens on 11/11 (often at 11:11 a.m.). This dates back to celebrations before the Advent season or with harvest celebrations of St. Martin's Day. \n\nTraditionally a carnival feast was the last opportunity to eat well before the time of food shortage at the end of the winter during which one was limited to the minimum necessary. On what nowadays is called vastenavond (the days before fasting) all the remaining winter stores of lard, butter and meat which were left would be eaten, for it would soon start to rot and decay. The selected livestock had in fact already been slaughtered in November and the meat would be no longer preservable. All the food that had survived the winter had to be eaten to assure that everyone was fed enough to survive until the coming spring would provide new food sources.",

Surveying his well-filled shelves with an impatience unworthy of a scholar, Hume's \"History of England\" unhappily caught his eye. He took down the first volume. In less than half an hour he discovered that Hume could do nothing for him. Wisely inspired, he turned to the truer history next, which men call fiction. The writings of the one supreme genius, who soars above all other novelists as Shakespeare soars above all other dramatists--the writings of Walter Scott--had their place of honour in his library. The collection of the Waverley Novels at Tadmor had not been complete. Enviable Amelius had still to read _Rob Roy._ He opened the book. For the rest of the day he was in love with Diana Vernon; and when he looked out once or twice at the garden to rest his eyes, he saw \"Andrew Fairservice\" busy over the flowerbeds. \n\nHe closed the last page of the noble story as Toff came in to lay the cloth for dinner. \n\nThe master at table and the servant behind his chair were accustomed to gossip pleasantly during meals. Amelius did his best to carry on the talk as usual. But he was no longer in the delightful world of illusion which Scott had opened to him. The hard realities of his own everyday life had gathered round him again. Observing him with unobtrusive attention, the Frenchman soon perceived the absence of the easy humour and the excellent appetite which distinguished his young master at other times. ",

The morning was bright and the sun touched the east window with vivid color and pierced the narrow lancets on the south. Red and green reflections stained the mosaics inside the chancel rails, but shadows lurked behind the arches and pillars, for the old building had no clerestory. \n\nMabel was bridesmaid, Marston was groomsman, and as he waited for a few moments by the rails he looked about. Commodore Chisholm had numerous friends, and for the most part Marston knew the faces turned towards the chancel. He had sailed hard races against some of the men and danced with their wives and daughters. They were sober English folk, and he was glad they had come to stamp with their approval his partner's wedding. Some, however, he could not see, because they sat back in the gloom. \n\nThen he glanced at his companions. He was nervous, but Mabel was marked by her serene calm. Flora's look was rather fixed, and although she had not much color, her pose was resolute and proud. Marston wondered whether she felt she was making something of a plunge; but if she did so, he knew she would not hesitate. Chisholm's face was quiet and perhaps a trifle stern; he looked rather old, and Marston imagined him resigned. The Commodore was frank; one generally knew what he felt. All three looked typically English, but Wyndham did not. Although his eyes were very blue and his hair was touched by red, he was different from the others. His face, as Marston saw it in profile, was thin and in a way ascetic, but it wore a stamp of recklessness. His pose was strangely alert and highly strung. There was something exotic about him. ",

One day, Charlie showed up at the zoo that he worked at and saw that a turtle had escaped! He quickly picked up the radio and told all of the other workers to look out for the missing Turtle named Brian. Because of this, the zoo had to close down for the whole day! They were trying so hard, but still could not find any clue to where the turtle went. Finally, a girl named Samantha went on the radio and said that she found Brian eating lettuce in the Polar Bear cage. She also told everyone that the Polar Bears were protecting Brian! For hours, the zoo team tried to find a way to get Brian out of the cage without getting hurt themselves. Charlie finally had an idea. He was going to take a stuffed turtle from the gift shop, sneak into the cage, put the Polar Bears to sleep for a little bit, and then place the stuffed turtle where Brian was eating his lettuce. Charlie's plan worked, but the Polar Bears woke up and weren't happy! They took the stuffed turtle and ripped it up!

We are bringing out equipment to begin operations to sever the drillpipe, plugback the well and bypass,\" Scherie Douglas, a BP regulatory advisor, told the district engineer for the U.S. Interior Department's Minerals Management Service in a March 10 e-mail. \n\nIn a follow-up e-mail to the district engineer, Frank Patton, Douglas reported the company wanted to get a plug set in the well before testing the blowout preventer, the massive device used to shut down the well in case of an emergency. \n\n\"With the give and take of the well and hole behavior we would feel much more comfortable getting at least one of the two plugs set in order to fully secure the well prior to testing BOPs,\" she wrote. \n\nWhen Patton told BP he could not delay a test any longer than it took to bring the well under control, the company won a postponement from David Trocquet, the MMS district manager in New Orleans, Louisiana, the documents show. Trocquet ordered BP to make sure its cement plug was set up and to verify its placement, according to his reply. The messages do not indicate how long the test was postponed. \n\nThe exchange was among the documents released Sunday by leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is looking into the disaster that killed 11 workers aboard the drilling platform Deepwater Horizon and uncapped a gusher that is now fouling the northern Gulf of Mexico.

      "story": "Mary was a little girl who loved to sew. She liked to sew dresses, shirts, and skirts but Mary hated to sew quilts. She didn't like anything about sewing quilts and blankets because it took too long. One quilt or blanket took a week to make, when a skirt or shirt took one night! Mary's mother didn't understand why Mary didn't like to sew quilts and blankets because Mary's mother loved to! \n\nMary was a normal little girl even if her friends didn't think so all the time. Mary's friends liked to play games and play outside but all Mary liked was to sew. She woke up and she began to sew. She only stopped to eat and use the bathroom. Mary's father was very worried about Mary. He said that little girls needed to laugh and play, not sew all the time. \n\nOne day Mary's father took Mary's sewing things and gave them to the poor children. \"No more sewing, Mary!\" He said. He wanted her to go laugh and play with her friends instead of sew but instead of going outside to play she ran into her room and cried. Mary was very sad that she couldn't sew any more. Soon her friends came over to see why Mary hadn't come over to play like her father said she would. When they saw her crying on her bed they had to think of a way to cheer her up. Billy said that maybe they could let her sew at their houses. Abby thought it was a great idea. So then all Mary's friends bought sewing things with their money so that Mary would be happy again. When Mary's father saw Mary go to one of her friend's house he was very happy. Soon everyone was happy again.",

Founded by Methodists and Quakers in the present-day town of Trinity in 1838, the school moved to Durham in 1892. In 1924, tobacco and electric power industrialist James Buchanan Duke established The Duke Endowment, at which time the institution changed its name to honor his deceased father, Washington Duke. \n\nDuke's campus spans over on three contiguous campuses in Durham as well as a marine lab in Beaufort. The main campus\u2014designed largely by architect Julian Abele\u2014incorporates Gothic architecture with the Duke Chapel at the campus' center and highest point of elevation. The first-year-populated East Campus contains Georgian-style architecture, while the main Gothic-style West Campus away is adjacent to the Medical Center. Duke is the seventh-wealthiest private university in America with $11.4 billion in cash and investments in fiscal year 2014. \n\nDuke's research expenditures in the 2015 fiscal year were $1.037 billion, the seventh largest in the nation. In 2014, Thomson Reuters named 32 of Duke's professors to its list of Highly Cited Researchers, making it fourth globally in terms of primary affiliations. Duke also ranks fifth among national universities to have produced Rhodes, Marshall, Truman, Goldwater, and Udall Scholars. Ten Nobel laureates and three Turing Award winners are affiliated with the university. Duke's sports teams compete in the Atlantic Coast Conference and the basketball team is renowned for having won five NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championships, most recently in 2015.",

The noise was coming from a nearby tree. She walked over to the tree to take a look and found a puppy curled up by the roots. It was making a loud, sad noise. Sally bent down and picked up the puppy. It quickly quieted down, and licked her face. Sally laughed. The puppy was brown with white paws, and she thought it was the cutest puppy she ever saw. She couldn't find a tag on him, so she took him home. When she got home, she fed the puppy some meat that she had in her fridge. The puppy seemed to like it. She also gave him a bowl of water and he lapped it all up. Then the puppy yawned. Sally picked him up and brought him to her bed and put him on her pillow. Sally looked at him with a smile. \"I'm going to call you...Jackson.\" Jackson wagged his tail a little, and fell asleep.",

It is bordered to the north by the Gulf of Finland, to the west by the Baltic Sea, to the south by Latvia (343 km), and to the east by Lake Peipus and Russia (338.6 km). Across the Baltic Sea lies Sweden in the west and Finland in the north. The territory of Estonia consists of a mainland and 2,222 islands and islets in the Baltic Sea, covering 45,339 km2 (17,505 sq mi) of land, and is influenced by a humid continental climate. \n\nAfter centuries of Danish, Swedish and German rule the native Estonians started to yearn for independence during the period of national awakening while being governed by the Russian Empire. Established on 24 February 1918, the Republic of Estonia came into existence towards the end of World War I. During World War II, Estonia was then occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940, then Nazi Germany a year later and again in 1944 establishing the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1988, during the Singing Revolution, the Estonian SSR issued the Estonian Sovereignty Declaration to defy against the illegal Soviet rule. Estonia then restored its independence during the 1991 coup by the Soviets on the night of 20 August 1991.",

There was a little pleasure-launch on Willey Water and several rowing boats, and guests could take tea either in the marquee that was set up in the grounds of the house, or they could picnic in the shade of the great walnut tree at the boat-house by the lake. This year the staff of the Grammar-School was invited, along with the chief officials of the firm. Gerald and the younger Criches did not care for this party, but it had become customary now, and it pleased the father, as being the only occasion when he could gather some people of the district together in festivity with him. For he loved to give pleasures to his dependents and to those poorer than himself. But his children preferred the company of their own equals in wealth. They hated their inferiors' humility or gratitude or awkwardness. \n\nNevertheless they were willing to attend at this festival, as they had done almost since they were children, the more so, as they all felt a little guilty now, and unwilling to thwart their father any more, since he was so ill in health. Therefore, quite cheerfully Laura prepared to take her mother's place as hostess, and Gerald assumed responsibility for the amusements on the water. \n\nBirkin had written to Ursula saying he expected to see her at the party, and Gudrun, although she scorned the patronage of the Criches, would nevertheless accompany her mother and father if the weather were fine.

      "story": "Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the United States and United Kingdom during the mid-1950s. The terms \"popular music\" and \"pop music\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \"Pop\" and \"rock\" were roughly synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they became increasingly differentiated from each other. \n\nAlthough pop music is seen as just the singles charts, it is not the sum of all chart music. Pop music is eclectic, and often borrows elements from other styles such as urban, dance, rock, Latin, and country; nonetheless, there are core elements that define pop music. Identifying factors include generally short to medium-length songs written in a basic format (often the verse-chorus structure), as well as common use of repeated choruses, melodic tunes, and hooks. \n\nDavid Hatch and Stephen Millward define pop music as \"a body of music which is distinguishable from popular, jazz, and folk musics\". According to Pete Seeger, pop music is \"professional music which draws upon both folk music and fine arts music\". Although pop music is seen as just the singles charts, it is not the sum of all chart music. The music charts contain songs from a variety of sources, including classical, jazz, rock, and novelty songs. Pop music, as a genre, is seen as existing and developing separately. Thus \"pop music\" may be used to describe a distinct genre, designed to appeal to all, often characterized as \"instant singles-based music aimed at teenagers\" in contrast to rock music as \"album-based music for adults\".",

      "story": "In seventh grade, Brittany Blythe dreamed of being a cheerleader. Her school's coaches were less than enthusiastic. \"They said, 'I don't know how you'll be able to do it,' she recalls. \"'You won't be able to do it. '\" \n\nBut Brittany, now a junior at Strath Haven High School near Philadelphia, persisted . And when the junior team cheerleaders won a tournament last year, she was right there, dancing and cheering with the rest of the team. \n\nNot bad for someone whose legs were cut off below the knee when she was two years old. \n\nBrittany, 18, was born without shinbones --\"just blood and muscle tissue\", as she puts it. When she tried to walk, her legs twisted. \n\nAfter the operation, she adapted quickly. \"From day one, I basically jumped up and wanted to do everything,\" she says. Prosthetic legs allowed her to move around upright, but too slowly to keep up with her friends. Brittany's solution: take the legs off and walk on her knees---sometimes she still does when safety and comfort permit. \n\nShe's rarely _ . Other children laughed at her through the years, especially in junior high school, but she says the challenge only made her stronger. Now she's trying to convince her coaches to let her remove the prostheses and be a flyer, the cheerleader who's thrown in the air and caught by her teammates. \n\nBrittany doesn't think her problems are more difficult than the next person's. \"My disability was the first thing I had to get through, and that's going to prepare me for the future,\" she says. \"It's all just a test: If someone throws you a curve ball , what are you going to do?\"",

We shall want housings for this second horse, master.\" \n\n\"Yes; there will be no difficulty about that. There are scores of dead horses on the field; choose one without any embroidery or insignia. You may as well take another pair of holsters with pistols.\" \n\nRiding across to the spot where Enghien and his officers were forming up the prisoners, talking courteously to the Spanish officers and seeing to the wounded, Hector, leaving Paolo to find his fallen horse and shift his trappings to the one that he rode, cantered up to the spot where Enghien's white plume could be seen in the midst of a group of officers, among whom was General Gassion. He saluted as he came up. \n\n\"I am glad indeed to see you, Captain Campbell,\" Enghien said warmly, holding out his hand; \"I feared that you were killed.

It was first printed at the Mirror printing plant, owned by Jesse Yarnell and T.J. Caystile. Unable to pay the printing bill, Cole and Gardiner turned the paper over to the Mirror Company. In the meantime, S. J. Mathes had joined the firm, and it was at his insistence that the \"Times\" continued publication. In July 1882, Harrison Gray Otis moved from Santa Barbara to become the paper's editor. Otis made the \"Times\" a financial success. \n\nHistorian Kevin Starr wrote that Otis was a businessman \"capable of manipulating the entire apparatus of politics and public opinion for his own enrichment\". Otis's editorial policy was based on civic boosterism, extolling the virtues of Los Angeles and promoting its growth. Toward those ends, the paper supported efforts to expand the city's water supply by acquiring the rights to the water supply of the distant Owens Valley. The efforts of the \"Times\" to fight local unions led to the October 1, 1910 bombing of its headquarters, killing twenty-one people. Two union leaders, James and Joseph McNamara, were charged.

They become experts at spotting liars. The condition in which people lose their power to understand or use words due to brain damage are called aphasia . A study conducted in Massachusetts, U.S., has clearly proved that aphasics make good lie detectors . \n\nIn the last 100 years, many doctors studying the brain have mentioned examples of this amazing power of patients suffering from aphasia. Recently, scientists conducted tests to see if all that was said about aphasics was true. They studied the powers of a mixed group of people. Some were normal; others were aphasic. And it was proved clearly that the normal volunteers still got fooled by words. The aphasics were far ahead of them in recognizing false speech. The results of the study were reported in the magazine Nature. \n\n`Fourteen years ago, famous American doctor, Dr. Oliver Sacks, wrote about his experiences with aphasic patients in a book. He remembered a particular incident in a hospital. Patients from the aphasia room were watching TV. Their president, Ronald Reagan, was giving a speech. He was trying to put feelings into each and every word of his speech. But his speech had an opposite effect on the patients. They were not impressed. On the contrary, the whole room shook with their laughter. The aphasics knew that he did not mean a word of what he was saying. \n\nDr. Sacks saw aphasics as more gifted than normal people. Normal people \"get carried away\" by words. An aphasic cannot understand words. But he or she can still understand what is being said. He said most of the aphasics had this superior understanding. So, while normal people think of aphasic patients as brain damaged, they actually seem to understand human expressions better.",

The consolidated city-county covers an area of about at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula in the San Francisco Bay Area. It is the fourth-most populous city in California, and the 13th-most populous in the United States, with a 2016 census-estimated population of 870,887. The population is projected to reach 1 million by 2033. \n\nSan Francisco was founded on June 29, 1776, when colonists from Spain established Presidio of San Francisco at the Golden Gate and Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds a few miles away, all named for St. Francis of Assisi. The California Gold Rush of 1849 brought rapid growth, making it the largest city on the West Coast at the time. San Francisco became a consolidated city-county in 1856. After three-quarters of the city was destroyed by the 1906 earthquake and fire, San Francisco was quickly rebuilt, hosting the Panama-Pacific International Exposition nine years later. In World War II, San Francisco was a major port of embarkation for service members shipping out to the Pacific Theater. It then became the birthplace of the United Nations in 1945. After the war, the confluence of returning servicemen, massive immigration, liberalizing attitudes, along with the rise of the \"hippie\" counterculture, the Sexual Revolution, the Peace Movement growing from opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War, and other factors led to the Summer of Love and the gay rights movement, cementing San Francisco as a center of liberal activism in the United States.

The exclave province of Cabinda has borders with the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

He had to raise his voice to make himself heard above the fury of the elements. \n\n\"That's true, but where are we to go?\" questioned Roger. The look in his eyes showed his keen anxiety. \n\n\"Isn't there some kind of a cliff around here, under which we can stand?\" asked Granbury Lapham of the sleigh driver. Hendrik shrugged his shoulders for a moment, then suddenly tossed his head. \n\n\"Yes, I know such a spot,\" he said, in his native tongue. \"Come, we will try to reach it before it is too late.\" \n\nAmid the howling of the wind and the swirling of the snow, the horses and sleigh were turned partly around, and they struck off on a side trail, leading up the mountain. On and on they toiled, a distance of perhaps five hundred feet, although to the boys it seemed a mile or more. The wind was so strong it fairly took their breath away, and the snow all but blinded them. They had to walk, for it was all the double team could do to drag the turnout over the rough rocks and through the snow. Once Dave slipped, bumped against the Englishman, and both rolled downward a distance of several yards. \n\n\"Excuse me!\" panted the young American. \"My feet went up before I was aware.\" \n\n\"Don't mention it, my lad,\" was the gasped-out answer. \"I fancy we're all doing the best we can.\" ",

      "story": "(CNN) -- History was made on two fronts when Joao Sousa beat Julien Benneteau to win the Malaysian Open. \n\nWhile Sousa celebrated becoming the first Portuguese man to claim an ATP title, Benneteau wasn't nearly as joyous. He slumped to 0-9 in finals to tie the unwanted men's record in the Open era, which began in 1968. \n\nIs he tennis' unlucky loser? \n\nBenneteau's fellow Frenchman, Cedric Pioline, and American Pat Dupre also lost their first nine finals, although Pioline went on to triumph five times -- he was a two-time grand slam finalist -- and Dupre ended his drought in Hong Kong in 1982. \n\nNo man has lost his first 10 finals in the Open era, said the ATP. \n\nBenneteau was so close to overturning his woe in finals, too, holding a match point in the second set Sunday against Sousa. \n\nHe did little wrong on the point, approaching the net with a good forehand, but Sousa unleashed a stunning forehand down the line. \n\nBenneteau then wasted a flurry of break points in the final set and fell 2-6 7-5 6-4. \n\nFrench sports daily L'Equipe used the headline, 'Benneteau, nothing new,' when referring to his defeat on its website, and the player tweeted a picture of what looked like a beer accompanied by the words: 'To forget.' \n\n\"I tried everything today,\" Benneteau, 31, told the ATP's website. \"I played very well, particularly I was very aggressive and I didn't let him play for two sets almost. I had match point and I played the point perfectly. ",

Tonight was one of those nights. As she lay in bed, Sally couldn't help but think of all the fun things she would be doing the next day. She would build sand castles, splash in the water, and play Frisbee with her older brother, Jared. All of theses thoughts and more raced through her head, until finally she fell asleep. In the early hours of the morning, Sally awoke to her brother making loud noises in her ear. He was so annoying. A little bit later, her mother and father came in the room, helping Sally and Jared get ready for the day. When everyone was dressed and all of their belongings were packed, the whole family set off for a day of fun in the sun. The ride was long and their van was hot and stuffy, even with the windows rolled down. After what seemed like hours, Sally spotted the road sign signaling that the beach was close! Sally's mother said that they could stop for some frozen yogurt on the way since it was so hot outside. Sally and Jared both cheered. They pulled up to the shop and went inside, the cool air hitting their faces as they opened the door. There were so many different flavors! Jared always got chocolate, because that was Dad's favorite flavor, too. Mom chose strawberry because it seemed perfect for this hot weather. Sally couldn't choose. She really wanted mint chocolate chip, but they were all out. Finally she chose the shop's special flavor \"Tropical Turtle\". The family left with smiles on their faces, ready to have a great day at the beach.",

He was an American writer of novels and short stories, whose works are the typical writings of the Jazz Age, a term he created himself. \n\nBorn into an upper middle-class Irish Catholic family, Fitzgerald was named after his famous second cousin, Francis Scott Key. He was also named after his deceased sister Louise Scott, one of two sisters who died shortly before his birth. He spent 1898-1901 in Syracuse and 1903-1908 in Buffalo, New York, where he attended Nardin Academy. When his father was fired from his company, the family returned to Minnesota, where Fitzgerald attended St. Paul Academy from 1908 to1911. \n\nHe is widely regarded as one of the 20th century's greatest writers. Fitzgerald is considered to be a member of the \"Lost Generation\" of the 1920s. He finished four novels, This Side of Paradise, The Beautiful and Damned, Tender Is the Night and his most famous classic novel, The Great Gatsby. A fifth, unfinished novel, The Love of the Last Tycoon was published after his death. Fitzgerald also wrote many short stories that dealt with themes of youth. \n\nHis first literary work, a detective story, was published in a school newspaper when he was 12. When he was 16, he was forced to leave St. Paul Academy for neglecting his studies. He attended Newman School, a prep school in Hackensack, New Jersey, in 1911-1912, and entered Princeton University in 1913 as a member of the Class of 1917. There he became friends with future critics and writers Edmund Wilson (Class of 1916) and John Peale Bishop (Class of 1917), and wrote for the Princeton Triangle Club.

He was an American writer of novels and short stories, whose works are the typical writings of the Jazz Age, a term he created himself. \n\nBorn into an upper middle-class Irish Catholic family, Fitzgerald was named after his famous second cousin, Francis Scott Key. He was also named after his deceased sister Louise Scott, one of two sisters who died shortly before his birth. He spent 1898-1901 in Syracuse and 1903-1908 in Buffalo, New York, where he attended Nardin Academy. When his father was fired from his company, the family returned to Minnesota, where Fitzgerald attended St. Paul Academy from 1908 to1911. \n\nHe is widely regarded as one of the 20th century's greatest writers. Fitzgerald is considered to be a member of the \"Lost Generation\" of the 1920s. He finished four novels, This Side of Paradise, The Beautiful and Damned, Tender Is the Night and his most famous classic novel, The Great Gatsby. A fifth, unfinished novel, The Love of the Last Tycoon was published after his death. Fitzgerald also wrote many short stories that dealt with themes of youth. \n\nHis first literary work, a detective story, was published in a school newspaper when he was 12.

Then, she jumped all the way to the top shelf, where the yarn was. \"Look out below!\" she yelled, and pushed the ball of yarn off the shelf and on to the floor. \n\n\"Whoa!\" said Fuzzy. \"Thanks!\" Snowball then jumped down to the middle shelf, and down to the table, and down to the couch, and back to the floor.

We will hold Julissa in our hearts every day.\" \n\nPhilip Markoff, 23, a second-year student at Boston University's School of Medicine, is charged with killing Brisman on April 14 at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel. \n\nPolice have said that Brisman, a model from New York, advertised as a masseuse on the online classifieds Web site Craigslist. They say Markoff may have met her through the online site. \n\nProsecutors say Brisman sustained blunt head trauma, and said she was shot three times at close range. One of the bullets passed through her heart, killing her, prosecutors said. \n\nMarkoff, who was arraigned Tuesday, is being held without bail. His attorney, John Salsberg, told reporters after the hearing that Markoff is \"not guilty of the charges. He has his family's support. I have not received any document or report or piece of evidence other than what I heard in the courtroom. All I have at the moment are words -- no proof of anything.\" ",

It was a little tougher than the scoreline suggests,\" Lions head coach Warren Gatland said after the match in Hong Kong. \n\n\"I think the scoreline reflected our dominance. I was genuinely very, very pleased with that today. It was tough out there. The players said (the ball) was a like a bar of soap with the humidity and the heat.\" \n\nIn the hot and sticky night air -- the temperature hovering around 30C in the windless Hong Kong Stadium -- the Lions ran in eight tries to one against the scratch team of internationals that last weekend had lost 40-12 to England. \n\nLed by the normally dynamic captain of Italy, Sergio Parisse, who said the conditions were the toughest he'd played in, the Barbarians forwards seemed determined to physically test their opposition early on. \n\nScottish fullback Stuart Hogg, the Lions' youngest player at 20, looked to get his tour off on a positive note but the beginning of a scything run a couple of minutes into the match was brought to juddering halt by a crunching tackle by Barbarians center Casey Lualala. \n\nThen after just eight minutes South African Schalk Brits, forgetting any club loyalty, sent a punch towards his Saracens teammate and Lions flyhalf Owen Farrell, earning the Barbarians' hooker a yellow card and 10 minutes off the field.

      "story": "Evolutionary biology is the subfield of biology that studies the evolutionary processes that produced the diversity of life on Earth, starting from a single common ancestor. These processes include natural selection, common descent, and speciation. \n\nThe discipline emerged through what Julian Huxley called the modern synthesis (of the 1930s) of understanding from several previously unrelated fields of biological research, including genetics, ecology, systematics and paleontology. \n\nCurrent research has widened to cover the genetic architecture of adaptation, molecular evolution, and the different forces that contribute to evolution including sexual selection, genetic drift and biogeography. The newer field of evolutionary developmental biology (\"evo-devo\") investigates how embryonic development is controlled, thus creating a wider synthesis that integrates developmental biology with the fields covered by the earlier evolutionary synthesis. \n\nEvolution is the central unifying concept in biology. Biology can be divided in various ways. One way is by the level of biological organisation, from molecular to cell, organism to population. An earlier way is by perceived taxonomic group, with fields such as zoology, botany, and microbiology, reflecting what were once seen as the major divisions of life. A third way is by approach, such as field biology, theoretical biology, experimental evolution, and paleontology. These alternative ways of dividing up the subject can be combined with evolutionary biology to create subfields like evolutionary ecology and evolutionary developmental biology.",

      "story": "CHAPTER 71 \n\nThe terrace of the Villa Catalano, with its orange and palm trees, looked upon a sea of lapiz lazuli, and rose from a shelving shore of aloes and arbutus. The waters reflected the color of the sky, and all the foliage wag bedewed with the same violet light of morn which bathed the softness of the distant mountains, and the undulating beauty of the ever-varying coast. \n\nLothair was walking on the terrace, his favorite walk, for it was the duly occasion on which he ever found himself alone. Not that he had any reason to complain of his companions. More complete ones could scarcely be selected. Travel, which, they say, tries all tempers, had only proved the engaging equanimity of Catesby, and had never disturbed the amiable repose of his brother priest: and then they were so entertaining and so instructive, as well as handy and experienced in all common things. The monsignore had so much taste and feeling, and various knowledge; and as for the reverend father, all the antiquaries they daily encountered were mere children in his hands, who, without effort, could explain and illustrate every scene and object, and spoke as if he had never given a thought to any other theme than Sicily and Syracuse, the expedition of Nicias, and the adventures of Agathocles. And yet, during all their travels, Lothair felt that he never was alone. This was remarkable at the great cities, such as Messina and Palermo, but it was a prevalent habit in less-frequented places. There was a petty town near them, which he had never visited alone, although he had made more than one attempt with that view; and it was only on the terrace in the early morn, a spot whence he could be observed from the villa, and which did not easily communicate with the precipitous and surrounding scenery, that Lothair would indulge that habit of introspection which he had pursued through many a long ride, and which to him was a never-failing source of interest and even excitement.

      "story": "The Black Death is thought to have originated in the arid plains of Central Asia, where it then travelled along the Silk Road, reaching Crimea by 1343. From there, it was most likely carried by Oriental rat fleas living on the black rats that were regular passengers on merchant ships. Spreading throughout the Mediterranean and Europe, the Black Death is estimated to have killed 30\u201360% of Europe's total population. In total, the plague reduced the world population from an estimated 450 million down to 350\u2013375 million in the 14th century. The world population as a whole did not recover to pre-plague levels until the 17th century. The plague recurred occasionally in Europe until the 19th century. \n\nThe plague disease, caused by Yersinia pestis, is enzootic (commonly present) in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents, including marmots, in various areas including Central Asia, Kurdistan, Western Asia, Northern India and Uganda. Nestorian graves dating to 1338\u201339 near Lake Issyk Kul in Kyrgyzstan have inscriptions referring to plague and are thought by many epidemiologists to mark the outbreak of the epidemic, from which it could easily have spread to China and India. In October 2010, medical geneticists suggested that all three of the great waves of the plague originated in China. In China, the 13th century Mongol conquest caused a decline in farming and trading. However, economic recovery had been observed at the beginning of the 14th century. In the 1330s a large number of natural disasters and plagues led to widespread famine, starting in 1331, with a deadly plague arriving soon after. Epidemics that may have included plague killed an estimated 25 million Chinese and other Asians during the 15 years before it reached Constantinople in 1347.",

Their wish may come true soon thanks to an unlikely source: Silicon Valley. \n\nThe mecca of the technology universe is in the process of revolutionizing higher education in a way that educators, colleges and universities cannot, or will not. \n\nOne of the men responsible for what may be an Athens-like renaissance is Sebastian Thrun, Google's vice president and pioneer in artificial intelligence and robotics. Known in science circles for his engineering feats -- like Stanley, the self-driving car -- Thrun is using his technological prowess to make quality higher education available to the world. I recently interviewed him on my radio show, \"Morning In America.\" \n\nLast year, while teaching a graduate level artificial intelligence class at Stanford University, Thrun lamented that his course could only reach 200 students in the suburbs of Palo Alto. So, he decided to offer his own free online class, with the same homework, quizzes and tests that he gives to Stanford students. \n\nHe announced the proposal with a single e-mail. Before he knew it, he had a flood of takers. \"Usually I reach about 200 students and now I reach 160,000,\" said Thrun incredulously. \"In my entire life of education I didn't have as much an impact on people as I had in these two months.\" \n\nBy utilizing online videos and educational resources, Thrun's class was being accessed by students from all corners of the world. In fact, the students themselves translated the class for free from English into 44 languages. ",

If you prefer offbeat places, check out the following roadside attractions. \n\nWorld's Largest Ball of Paint \n\nAlexandria, Ind. \n\nIn 1977, Michael Carmichael set out to create the biggest ball of paint anywhere. Starting with a baseball as centre, he painted layer by layer of paint day after day, year after year. The ball weighs more than 1,300 pounds, with more than 20,000 coats of paint, which is recognized by Guinness World Record. Visitors can paint the wall themselves and become part of the history. \n\nThe Museum of Dirt \n\nBoston, Mass. \n\nThe museum is the idea of Glenn Johnson. Labeled glass bottles contain such treasures as dirt from the Great Wall of China, as well as sand from a desert in Saudi Arabia and Omaha Beach in France. Best of all, the cost of seeing this museum is dirt cheap: It's free. \n\nMount Horeb Mustard Museum \n\nMount Horeb, Wis. \n\nIt's heaven for hotdog lovers! This museum says it has to have the world's largest collection for prepared mustard . Its more than 4,100 bottles of spices come from 60 nations, including Turkey and China. Visitors learn the history of mustard, from how it's made to how it's advertised and sold. The museum's creator, Barry Levenson, loves mustard so much that he even puts it on ice-cream! \n\nPaper House \n\nRockport, Mass. \n\nSwedish immigrant Ellis Stenman was much ahead of his time in 1922, when he started to build a two-room house almost entirely out of newspaper. At the time, people didn't give much---if any---thought to recycling paper. In fact, \"recycling\" wasn't even a word yet. The house is framed with wood, but the walls are made of 210 layers of newspaper. In all, he used about 100,000 newspapers.",

She didn't like leaving the children alone in the car, but the baby was sleeping soundly. And it would only be a moment. \n\nShe had hardly walked 40 yards when she saw the car moving. It headed straight towards the river. Unable to swim, Joy shouted, \"My babies are in that car!\" \n\nDaniel Whitehead, a 17-year-old student, was walking by the river when the Buick crashed into the water just yards ahead .Without thinking, Daniel jumped in. Though a competitive swimmer, he was shocked by the icy chill. \n\nTwo minutes earlier, Skip Womack had pulled to a halt as the Buick ran in front of him. Now seeing it hit the water and hearing Joy's cries, Skip got out of his truck and jumped into the water. He had only one thought: If I don't get them out, they'll drown. \n\nDaniel reached the car and grabbed a door handle. But the water was only four inches beneath the window, and the door wouldn't open. With one powerful punch, Daniel and Skip broke a window. Daniel reached inside and lifted Stephen out. He placed him on his back and set out for shore. At the same time, Skip squeezed himself through the window .He managed to free Esther from beneath her seat belt. After he got out of the car with the baby, he held her over the water and swam toward the shore. All this took place just seconds before the Buick disappeared beneath the water. \n\nLater, driving home, Skip thought of his wife and children--how close he'd come to leaving them behind. He thought of the miracle he'd lived through, and how two children were still alive because he and Daniel happened to be in the right place at the right time.",

      "story": "IPA Braille is the modern standard Braille encoding of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), as recognized by the International Council on English Braille. \n\nA braille version of the IPA was first created by Merrick and Potthoff in 1934, and published in London. It was used in France, Germany, and anglophone countries. However, it was not updated as the IPA evolved, and by 1989 had become obsolete. In 1990 it was officially reissued by BAUK, but in a corrupted form that made it largely unworkable. In 1997 BANA created a completely new system for the United States and Canada. However, it was incompatible with braille IPA elsewhere in the world and in addition proved to be cumbersome and often inadequate. In 2008 Robert Englebretson revised the Merrick and Potthoff notation and by 2011 this had been accepted by BANA. It is largely true to the original in consonants and vowels, though the diacritics were completely reworked, as necessitated by the major revisions in print IPA diacritics since 1934. The diacritics were also made more systematic, and follow rather than precede the base letters. However, it has no general procedure for marking tone, and not all diacritics can be written. \n\nIPA Braille does not use the conventions of English Braille. It is set off by slash or square brackets, which indicate that the intervening material is IPA rather than national orthography. Thus brackets are required in braille even when not used in print.",

Mr. Henry spent most of his life without even his closest family members knowing he was illiterate .Forced to quit school in the third grade to take some jobs, he kept the secret close to his chest - only telling to his late wife. A family problem in his 90s sparked his encourage to restart his education.\"He signed a document he could not read,\" Mr Henry's granddaughter said. And then, after hearing about George Dawson, a son of slaves who learned to read at the age of 98 and went on to write a book of his own, entitled \"Life Is So Good\" at the age of 101, Mr. Henry took up reading. \"If he can do it.I'm going to try,\" Mr. Henry said.Starting with his name, he eventually moved on to ABC's and children's books. He put them down for four years after the tragic loss of his wife. But eventually he went back to reading and with the help of his tutor began to record his life. He wrote about his family's voyage from Portugal to the U.S. his many journeys at sea and how he was unable to save another fisherman who had fallen overboard. He became a carpenter and even a professional boxer - and eventually built his own home in Stonington Borough. His life stories have become so popular, in fact, nearly 800 copies were sold in the first two weeks of the book's release last month.One thousand more have since been printed as requests for the book flood in from as far as Germany.And now even Hollywood producers have approached Mr. Henry about optioning the rights to his life story for a big screen adaptation.",

His parents had sent out 12 invites, thinking 6 or 8 kids would come. The clown started the show by squirting some water from a flower into John's face. This caused John's face to turn red. After the show, when everyone had left, it was up to John and Sara to clean up after the party. There was food everywhere; they had had salad and there was lettuce on the ground. Later that evening it was dinnertime and the family had to choose what to eat. The choices were order a pizza, make hamburgers, go get fried chicken or make noodles. Since it was Mike's birthday they let him choose. He really wanted pizza so they called up Pizza Palace to place their order. When the pizza arrived it did not come in a square box like most pizzas. Instead it was in a round box that no one had ever seen. John gave everybody a slice and then placed Mike in his lap to eat dinner.",

The university currently consists of 18 constituent colleges, nine research institutes and a number of central bodies. \n\nThe university is the largest university by number of full-time students in the United Kingdom, with 161,270 campus-based students and over 50,000 distance learning students in the University of London International Programmes. The university was established by royal charter in 1836, as a degree-awarding examination board for students holding certificates from University College London and King's College London and \"other such other Institutions, corporate or unincorporated, as shall be established for the purpose of Education, whether within the Metropolis or elsewhere within our United Kingdom\". The university moved to a federal structure in 1900. \n\nMost constituent colleges rank in the top 50 universities in the United Kingdom and for most practical purposes, ranging from admissions to funding, the constituent colleges operate on an independent basis, with some recently obtaining the power to award their own degrees whilst remaining in the federal university. The ten largest colleges of the university are UCL, King's College London, Queen Mary, City, Birkbeck, the London School of Economics and Political Science, Royal Holloway, Goldsmiths, SOAS, and St George's. The specialist colleges of the university include the London Business School, the Royal Veterinary College and Heythrop College, specialising in philosophy and theology.

      "story": "It's a nightmare for Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST): within a week, two students committed suicide by jumping off dorm buildings. \n\nOfficials from the university are reluctant to give interviews. \n\n\"We had a hard time calming down students who were shocked at the suicides,\" said Zhang Jingyuan, head of HUST's center for research and guidance for students' development. \n\n\"Media coverage may arouse some students' negative emotions again. Suicide can be contagious ,\" Zhang said. \n\nThe university reacted promptly to the first suicide on October 23. \n\nAdvisors and class leaders conducted dorm-to-dorm checks to find students suffering depression. Then psychologists offered one-on-one counseling to them. \n\nNotice boards publicizing tips for identifying peers' mental problems and offering help were set up in front of dorm buildings. Leaflets carrying similar information were handed out to each dorm. \n\nHowever, the second suicide came seven days later. \n\nBoth students were described as men of few words. Their schoolmates didn't see anything to indicate suicide. \n\nZhang revealed that the two students had been bothered by mental disorders. But the school didn't know this until the students' close friends outside school and their parents unveiled the truth after the suicides. \n\nAccording to Zhang, there are only three full-time counselors working in the university's counseling center for its 60,000 students. He complained: \"It's unrealistic to rely only on counselors to detect students' mental problems.\" \n\nSome universities in the US may be able to offer solutions to Zhang's worries. They have established programs to train students to be the bridge between troubled friends and counselors. \n\nAt Worcester Polytechnic Institute, at Worcester, Massachusetts, US, young people in the Student Support Network role play to learn how to detect SOS signals from their schoolmates. \n\nThey also practice how to gently persuade emotionally troubled students to go for professional help. \n\nTo develop such empathy , many universities in China have organized campus events to popularize knowledge about mental health. But these are not that attractive to students. \n\nKe Juanjuan, 24, is pursuing a master's degree in English translation at HUST. Ke has found that few of her peers will pay attention to activities about mental health when they are not troubled by it. \n\nRather than bombard students with the words \"mental health\", Ke suggested the school organize lectures and workshops concerning study, job-hunting and relationships. She explained: \"Students care about these topics. They tend to have problems in these areas and may thus get stuck in depression. \n\n\"By helping students better deal with these problems, the school can effectively prevent self-inflicted injury and suicide among students.\" \n\nEffective prevention comes from long-term education for life instead of temporary intervention to meet an emergency, said Hu Yi'an. Hu delivers a course of lectures on life and death at Guangzhou University. He worries that universities have paid little attention to education for life. \n\n\"Education for life helps students respect and love life so they won't resort to ending their lives when they have difficulties,\" said Hu. \n\nAccording to Hu, the principles can be incorporated into everyday teaching.",

He did not detail how, when or where the rescue operation took place. \n\n\"A special operation of Cameroonian armed forces and security services of friendly countries\" freed the man, he said. \n\nEberhard told journalists he was glad to be alive. \n\n\"I am happy to see all these people around me, who have rescued me and made sure that I survived, because until the last minute, I did not know whether I would survive or I would not survive. It was for me a big problem. Because it was darkness, total darkness, and you see nobody around you. Then this is a big problem to say OK, I will survive or not survive,\" Eberhard said. \n\nEberhard was flown in from Cameroon's Far North Region to Yaounde shortly after noon Wednesday. \n\nHe said he was grateful to all those who worked to secure his release. \n\nThe German ambassador to Cameroon, Klaus-Ludwig Keferstein, also thanked Cameroonian authorities, particularly because \"we could find a solution to this problem of hostage-taking,\" he said. \n\nEberhard spoke amid heavy security and mentioned that he was teaching at a vocational school in Gombe, Adamawa state, Nigeria, before the insurgents took him hostage in July. \n\nHe has been taken to the residence of the German ambassador in Yaounde. The ambassador said initial medical care will be given to him before he is flown back to Germany for more medical attention. ",

It should be almost as pleasant to us as to him to think that love was what made him do it, for he was sure he loved Grizel at last, and that the one longing of his heart was to marry her; the one marvel to him was that he had ever longed ardently for anything else. Well, as you know, she longed for it also, but she was firm in her resolve that until Elspeth was engaged Tommy should be a single man. She even made him promise not to kiss her again so long as their love had to be kept secret. \"It will be so sweet to wait,\" she said bravely. As we shall see presently, his efforts to put Elspeth into the hands of David were apparently of no avail, but though this would have embittered many men, it drew only to the surface some of Tommy's noblest attributes; as he suffered in silence he became gentler, more considerate, and acquired a new command over himself. To conquer self for her sake (this is in the \"Letters to a Young Man\") is the highest tribute a man can pay to a woman; it is the only real greatness, and Tommy had done it now.

During the birth of her younger son, Farrow began bleeding badly. Dr. Paris managed to solve the problem in a delicate procedure. \"Twenty years ago, she probably would have died,\" he says. Today, when he performs school sports physical examinations for the Farrow boys, 10 and 11, he is always reminded that lives are changed forever by doctors just doing their jobs. \n\nTo be a mix of country doc and somewhat adventurer, the 55-year-old family physician moved to Hailey after completing his residency . He hoped to practice medicine there and ski at nearby Sun Valley. Unfortunately, the only job opening was for an emergency-room doctor in Missoula, Montana, 300 miles away. Dr. Paris took it. \"I'd ski all day and then drive all night to be in Missoula for a 48-hour shift,\" he recalls. \"I'm lucky to be alive.\" Knowing he couldn't keep up with his eight-hour commute , he began taking flying lessons. \n\nIn 1981, Dr. Paris joined a small medical practice in Hailey, a former mining town with a population at the time of 2,109. As Hailey grew in the shadow of Sun Valley's booming popularity, Dr. Paris's own practice expanded to seven physicians, including his wife, Kathryn Woods, who is also a family doctor. They met in 1986 at a certification exam in Denver when, in a room full of men in stodgy suits, Woods arrived wearing a Lycra biking outfit and carrying the front wheel of her bicycle (which she couldn't lock up outside). Dr. Paris asked her out on the spot. In 1989, they married.",

By mid-day, trains laden with coal were rushing to several of the Channel ports. Maraton found his task with the miners more difficult, and yet in a way his triumph here was still more complete. He travelled down the backbone of England, preaching peace where war had reigned, promising great things in the name of the new Government. Although he had been absent barely forty-eight hours, it was a new London into which he travelled on his return. The streets were crowded once more with taxicabs, the evening papers were being sold, the shops were all open, the policemen were once more in the streets. Selingman, who had scarcely once left Maraton's side, gazed about him with wonder. \n\n\"It is a miracle, this,\" he declared. \"There is no aftermath.\" \n\n\"The people are waiting,\" Maraton said. \"We have given them serious pledges. Their day is to come.\" \n\n\"You believe that Foley will keep his word?\" Selingman asked. \n\n\"I know that he will,\" Maraton replied. \"As soon as the Bills are drafted, he will go to the country. It will be a new Party--the National Party. Stay and see it, Selingman--a new era in the politics of the world, a very wonderful era. The country is going to be governed for the people that are worth while.\" ",

His mother Mary n\u00e9e Nagle (c. 1702 \u2013 1770) was a Roman Catholic who hailed from a d\u00e9class\u00e9 County Cork family (and a cousin of Nano Nagle), whereas his father, a successful solicitor, Richard (died 1761), was a member of the Church of Ireland; it remains unclear whether this is the same Richard Burke who converted from Catholicism. The Burke dynasty descends from an Anglo-Norman knight surnamed de Burgh (latinised as de Burgo) who arrived in Ireland in 1185 following Henry II of England's 1171 invasion of Ireland. \n\nIn 1744, Burke started at Trinity College Dublin, a Protestant establishment, which up until 1793, did not permit Catholics to take degrees. In 1747, he set up a debating society, \"Edmund Burke's Club\", which, in 1770, merged with TCD's Historical Club to form the College Historical Society; it is the oldest undergraduate society in the world. The minutes of the meetings of Burke's Club remain in the collection of the Historical Society. Burke graduated from Trinity in 1748. Burke's father wanted him to read Law, and with this in mind he went to London in 1750, where he entered the Middle Temple, before soon giving up legal study to travel in Continental Europe. After eschewing the Law, he pursued a livelihood through writing.",

During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. It is considered a holy city in the three major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. \n\nDuring its long history, Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice, besieged 23 times, attacked 52 times, and captured and recaptured 44 times. The part of Jerusalem called the City of David was settled in the 4th millennium BCE. In 1538, walls were built around Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent.

They had been spending an hour in the mouldy little garden-house, where the colossal mask of the famous Juno looks out with blank eyes from that dusky corner which must seem to her the last possible stage of a lapse from Olympus. Then they had wandered out into the gardens, and were lounging away the morning under the spell of their magical picturesqueness. Roderick declared that he would go nowhere else; that, after the Juno, it was a profanation to look at anything but sky and trees. There was a fresco of Guercino, to which Rowland, though he had seen it on his former visit to Rome, went dutifully to pay his respects. But Roderick, though he had never seen it, declared that it could n't be worth a fig, and that he did n't care to look at ugly things. He remained stretched on his overcoat, which he had spread on the grass, while Rowland went off envying the intellectual comfort of genius, which can arrive at serene conclusions without disagreeable processes. When the latter came back, his friend was sitting with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands. Rowland, in the geniality of a mood attuned to the mellow charm of a Roman villa, found a good word to say for the Guercino; but he chiefly talked of the view from the little belvedere on the roof of the casino, and how it looked like the prospect from a castle turret in a fairy tale.

Yet Honington was the birthplace of Robert Bloomfield, known as \"the Suffolk poet\" in the early part of the last century (although Crabbe was living then and was great, as he is becoming again after many years); while at Sapiston, the rustic village on the other side of the old stone bridge, he acquired that love of nature and intimate knowledge of farm life and work which came out later in his Farmer's Boy. Finally, Troston, the little village in which I write, was the home of Capel Lofft, a person of importance in his day, who discovered Bloomfield, found a publisher for his poems, and boomed it with amazing success. \n\nI dare say it will only provoke a smile of amusement in readers of literary taste when I confess that Bloomfield's memory is dear to me; that only because of this feeling for the forgotten rustic who wrote rhymes I am now here, strolling about in the shade of the venerable trees in Troston Park-the selfsame trees which the somewhat fantastic Capel knew in his day as \"Homer,\" \"Sophocles,\" \"Virgil,\" \"Milton,\" and by other names, calling each old oak, elm, ash, and chestnut after one of the immortals.

She went to hospital twice. In November, I finally could get her back to her \"home\". Alice hoped that her daughter could come to visit her on Christmas Eve because she wanted to be with her family, like the old days. But her daughter was coming after Christmas, so she was very sad. I also felt sad because she would be alone on the holiday! On Christmas Eve, I took her to a candlelight service at church that night. I didn't take her to my church. I took her to the church in her old neighborhood. We got there early and I let her sit near the door, so people could see her when they came in. Soon some of her friends came to the church and they all talked to her and sat with her. Alice got a lot of love from her old and new friends there. She said she loved the gift like this. That night, I thought I got the best gift: the smile on Alice's face. .",

But the dreams may soon come true as research findings in laboratories are being turned into products more rapidly in the new century, according to experts participating in the fourth Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Technomart, a technology exhibition and trade fair in Suzhou. \n\n\"Most people think nano-technology is too far-fetched to be real. But in fact nano-technology has been applied in a wide range of fields, such as medicine. It is coming into our daily life,\" said Cheng Jiachong from a Hong Kong-based nano-technology firm. \n\nNano-technology based on the nanometer, the unit of which is a billionth of a meter, enables scientists to have new concepts of disease diagnosis and treatment on a molecular and atomic scale, Cheng said. \n\nBy using nanometer particles, a doctor can separate the fetus cells from the blood of a pregnant woman to see if the development of the fetus is normal. This method is also being used in the early diagnosis of cancer and heart disease, he said. \n\nOne of the most significant impacts of nano-technology is at the bio-inorganic materials interface, according to Greg Tegart, executive advisor of the APEC Center for Technology Foresight. \n\n\"By combining enzymes and silicon chips we can produce biosensors. These could be implanted in humans or animals to monitor health and to deliver corrective doses of drugs,\" he told the participants a technology forum during the exhibition. \n\n\"Nano-technology could affect the production of nearly every man-made object, from automobiles, tires and computer circuits , to advanced medicines and tissue replacement, and lead to the invention of objects yet to be imagined,\" said David Minns, a special advisor to the National Research Council of Canada. \n\nIt has been shown that carbon nano-tubes are ten times as strong as steel, with one sixth of the weight, and nano-scale systems have the potential to make supersonic transport cost- effective and to increase computer efficiency by millions of times, he said. \n\nThe experts agreed that the APEC technology exhibition and trade fair provided many chances for exchanges of innovative ideas and products.",

Unfortunately, these efforts all failed because the circumstances for rapprochement were not quite right -- unlike today, where Iran's new president, Hassan Rouhani, has been determined to outflank his ideological opponents in Tehran and reach a deal with the West. \n\nThe Obama administration seems equally determined -- despite opposition from Saudi Arabia and Israel, as well as an obstructive Congress -- to welcome the Iranians back into the international community, so long as they agree to play by the rules. \n\nThis is Obama's \"opening to China\" moment and he must seize it. \n\nEver since Iranian students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran on November 4, 1979 and initiated the 444-day Iran-hostage crisis, the United States and Iran have been regional arch-nemeses. Even so, in the thirty years since this traumatic event, there have been periodic efforts to improve relations. \n\nThe first episode occurred in 1985 when Israeli officials helped facilitate a back-channel approach to so-called Iranian \"moderates\", represented by Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. This led to the infamous \"Mission to Tehran\", where senior U.S. officials traveled to Tehran to trade weapons and spare parts in exchange for the release of American hostages held in Lebanon. This mission failed spectacularly. Details were leaked to the press, leading to the Iran-Contra scandal, which nearly brought the Reagan administration down. ",

      "story": "Johannesburg (CNN) -- A plane carrying Madagascar's ousted leader Marc Ravalomanana was turned away from Madagascan airspace Saturday as he tried to return from exile, his spokesman and the airline said. \n\nRavalomanana, who had been in South Africa in exile, took off from Johannesburg Saturday morning in what was his second bid to return to his home country. \n\nBut Ravalomanana's spokesman Patrick Gearing, in South Africa, told CNN that the civil aviation authorities on the Indian Ocean island had closed the airspace, refusing the plane permission to land. \n\nBy Saturday afternoon the plane -- and Ravalomanana -- were back in South Africa, said Gearing. \n\nRavalomanana was ousted in March 2009 through a coup backed by the military, which handed power to current President Andry Rajoelina, the youthful former mayor of Antananarivo. \n\nShortly before boarding his flight to the capital, Antananarivo, Ravalomanana said that he had just spoken with the Madagascan Prime Minister Omer Beriziky, who told him \"everything was OK.\" \n\nSpeaking before the flight took off, Gearing said: \"He has no control over what will happen to him when he arrives but he is prepared to face whatever comes his way.\" \n\nRavalomanana's previous unsuccessful effort to return last year came to an end in Johannesburg, when the airline he was using was told it wouldn't be allowed to land if he was on board. \n\nMadagascar is in the process of implementing a peace agreement facilitated by a regional body, the South African Development Community. \n\nGearing says Ravalomanana met with South Africa's President Jacob Zuma Friday to thank him for letting him stay following his ouster.

S. Air Force but he failed because of his poor eyesight. However, his dream remained. At the age of 33, Ted was a truck driver in Los Angeles. One day, while sitting outside in his garden, he watched planes fly overhead and an idea came to him: to use balloons to fly. A few weeks later, Ted bought 42 huge balloons. He tied them to a chair and then he sat down in the chair with some beer, sandwiches and a gun. His plan was to fly to 10 meters above his garden, enjoy a few hours in the air, and then shoot some balloons with his gun to get back down. But things did not go as he planned. Once his friends cut the ropes under Ted's chair, the 42 balloons flew into the sky at an astonishing speed until about 4000 meters above the ground with Ted and his chair. He didn't shoot any of the balloons because he was afraid he might break the balanee of his \"plane\". Ted stayed in the sky with his beer and sandwiches for 14 hours, cold and frightened. Planes heading towards Los Angeles' busy international airport reported the strange sight. And Ted' s balloons caused great danger to them. At last, Ted gathered his courage to shoot a few balloons and slowly landed on the ground, where many policemen were waiting for him. Ted made his dream come true, but it cost him: he was fined $ 1,500 for breaking the law about air safety. When asked by a reporter why he had done it, Ted answered, \"A man can't just sit around and do nothing; he should have his dream and go for it. \"",

The Lapita people discovered and settled the Samoan islands around 3,500 years ago. They developed a unique language and cultural identity. \n\nThe origins of the Samoans are closely studied in modern research about Polynesia in various scientific disciplines such as genetics, linguistics and anthropology. Scientific research is ongoing, although a number of different theories exist; including one proposing that the Samoans originated from Austronesian predecessors during the terminal eastward Lapita expansion period from Southeast Asia and Melanesia between 2,500 and 1,500 BCE. The Samoan origins are currently being reassessed due to new scientific evidence and carbon dating findings from 2003 and onwards.",

It is the national repository of all that is published in France. \n\nThe National Library of France traces its origin to the royal library founded at the Louvre Palace by Charles V in 1368. Charles had received a collection of manuscripts from his predecessor, John II, and transferred them to the Louvre from the Palais de la Cit\u00e9. The first librarian of record was Claude Mallet, the king's valet de chambre, who made a sort of catalogue, \"Inventoire des Livres du Roy nostre Seigneur estans au Chastel du Louvre\". Jean Blanchet made another list in 1380 and Jean de B\u00e9gue one in 1411 and another in 1424. Charles V was a patron of learning and encouraged the making and collection of books. It is known that he employed Nicholas Oresme, Raoul de Presle and others to transcribe ancient texts. At the death of Charles VI, this first collection was unilaterally bought by the English regent of France, the Duke of Bedford, who transferred it to England in 1424. It was apparently dispersed at his death in 1435. \n\nCharles VII did little to repair the loss of these books, but the invention of printing resulted in the starting of another collection in the Louvre inherited by Louis XI in 1461. Charles VIII seized a part of the collection of the kings of Aragon. Louis XII, who had inherited the library at Blois, incorporated the latter into the \"Biblioth\u00e8que du Roi\" and further enriched it with the Gruthuyse collection and with plunder from Milan. Francis I transferred the collection in 1534 to Fontainebleau and merged it with his private library. During his reign, fine bindings became the craze and many of the books added by him and Henry II are masterpieces of the binder's art.",

      "story": "Impressionism is a 19th-century art movement characterized by relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open composition, emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, inclusion of \"movement\" as a crucial element of human perception and experience, and unusual visual angles. Impressionism originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s. \n\nThe Impressionists faced harsh opposition from the conventional art community in France. The name of the style derives from the title of a Claude Monet work, \"Impression, soleil levant\" (\"Impression, Sunrise\"), which provoked the critic Louis Leroy to coin the term in a satirical review published in the Parisian newspaper \"Le Charivari\". \n\nThe development of Impressionism in the visual arts was soon followed by analogous styles in other media that became known as impressionist music and impressionist literature. \n\nRadicals in their time, early Impressionists violated the rules of academic painting. They constructed their pictures from freely brushed colours that took precedence over lines and contours, following the example of painters such as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix and J. M. W. Turner. They also painted realistic scenes of modern life, and often painted outdoors. Previously, still lifes and portraits as well as landscapes were usually painted in a studio. The Impressionists found that they could capture the momentary and transient effects of sunlight by painting \"en plein air\". They portrayed overall visual effects instead of details, and used short \"broken\" brush strokes of mixed and pure unmixed colour\u2014not blended smoothly or shaded, as was customary\u2014to achieve an effect of intense colour vibration.",

The following is a list of movies that Meryl Streep has been involved with: \n\nKramer vs. Krammer (1979) \n\nIn the film, Meryl plays a mother caught up in a custody dispute . Her co-star, Dustin Hoffman, said, \"She's extraordinarily hardworking. I think she thinks about nothing else but what she's doing.\" Meryl won her first Oscar for her performance in this film. \n\nSophie's Choice (1982) \n\nMeryl plays Sophie, a Polish war survivor. To prepare for the role she learned to speak German and perfected a Polish accent. Film critic Roger Ebert said, \"This is one of the most astonishing and yet one of the most natural performances I can imagine.\" Meryl won her second Best Actress Oscar for her performance. \n\nOut of Africa(1985) \n\nMeryl is Karen Blixen, a Danish woman living in Kenya in the early 20th century. The story follows Karens attempts to run a coffee plantation and her love affair with big-game hunter Denys. The film is based on the memoirs of the real Karen Blixen. \n\nA Cry in the Dark (1995) \n\nThis is based on the true-life case of the disappearance of baby Azaria. Meryl plays Linda Chamberlain, a mother who is wrongly accused of killing her own child. After spending four years in prison, it was found that wild dogs had taken away the baby. Meryl won Best Actress at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival. \n\nThe Bridge of Madison County (1995) \n\nThis movie is based on one of the biggest bestsellers of the 20th century (the book sold 50 million copies worldwide). Meryl plays Francesca Johnson, an Italian war bride living in 1960s Iowa. It's about her brief affair with photographer Robert Kincaid. \n\nMamma Mial(2008) \n\nThis is a romantic comedy based on the stage musical Mamma Mial, featuring the music from 1970s Swedish pop group ABBA. Meryl plays Donna Sheridan, a hotel owner on the Greek island of Kalokairi. Mamma Mial made over U.S. $ 600 million worldwide. Apparently, Meryl had seen the musical in 2001 and was completely absorbed in it. She had no idea that seven years later she'd be in the movie version.",

      "story": "When your pet meets your infant, it might not be love at first sniff. \n\nBaby's Best Friend \n\nWhen Jennifer Merritt brought her baby, Arielle, home from the hospital, her cherished dogs had very different reactions. Her boxer, Sonya, was immediately gentle and protective. But Tiger, the Pomeranian, was less welcoming: \"If any diapers or toys were on the floor, he peed on them!\"says the Greenbrier, prefix = st1 /Arkansas, mom. Tiger isn't the first dog to feel jealous of a baby. In the eyes of a pet's, there's a new star in town who's stealing his spotlight. Even the most gentle animal will probably act up if he doesn't get his usual attention. These simple steps will help your pet adjust -- and keep your baby safe. \n\nu Introduce Them with Care \n\nYour newborn and pet's first encounter can set the tone for their relationship. To make it as smooth as possible, try this trick from Caryn Ruiz, of Raleigh, North Carolina: \"Before we left the hospital, my husband took blankets home to our dog, Daisy, so she'd know our newborn Devon's smell.\" When you get home, have your husband carry the baby so you can greet your pet without worrying about her jumping on you. A cat will likely walk away at first, while a dog will probably want to investigate right away. \n\nTo introduce your baby, get down on your pet's level and let her have a hello sniff. Don't panic and pull your newborn away unless your pet is barking or hissing, because it'll send the message that the baby is a threat. \n\nu Learn the Safety Basics \n\nNo matter how smoothly the introduction goes, there are certain safety rules you should follow, says Bonnie Beaver, DVM, past president of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Number one: Never leave your baby alone with the pet. Even the gentlest animal can react unpredictably. Your baby's crying could frighten your cat, or your dog could suddenly become territorial. Consider setting up baby gates to limit your pet's access. To keep your cat from jumping into the bassinet , try putting mosquito netting over the top. Cats hate sticky paws, so keep the crib and changing table off-limits by lining the edges with sticky strips made for furniture (available in most pet stores). You can also train your dog to sleep in a crate.",

      "story": "Affirmative action in the United States tends to focus on issues such as education and employment, specifically granting special consideration to racial minorities, Native Americans, and women who have been historically excluded groups in America. Reports have shown that minorities and women have faced discrimination in schools and businesses for many years and this discrimination produced unfair advantages for whites and males in education and employment. The impetus toward affirmative action is redressing the disadvantages associated with past and present discrimination. Further impetus is a desire to ensure public institutions, such as universities, hospitals, and police forces, are more representative of the populations they serve. \n\nAffirmative action is a subject of controversy. Some policies adopted as affirmative action, such as racial quotas or gender quotas for collegiate admission, have been criticized as a form of reverse discrimination, and such implementation of affirmative action has been ruled unconstitutional by the majority opinion of Gratz v. Bollinger. Affirmative action as a practice was upheld by the Supreme Court's decision in Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003. Affirmative action policies were developed in order to correct decades of discrimination stemming from the Reconstruction Era by granting disadvantaged minorities opportunities. Many believe that the diversity of current American society suggests that affirmative action policies succeeded and are no longer required. Opponents of affirmative action argue that these policies are outdated and lead to reverse discrimination which entails favoring one group over another based upon racial preference rather than achievement.",

The sun was setting in the west and it was orange. A cold wind was blowing from north to south. Steve rode through a forest of pear trees next to his farm. \n\nThe first place he came to was a small town full of quiet people and its name was Silence. No one would talk to Steve. He kept riding. The town was next to a forest of maple trees. \n\nThe second town he came to was very cold and its name was Ice. Steve was afraid his horse would freeze if he stayed there. Everyone in the town was wearing large coats and mittens. The second town was next to a forest of pine trees. \n\nThe third town he came to was warm and it was named Sunny. There were palm trees on the beach. Steve and his horse went to the beach and played in the ocean. Steve took off his boots. Steve's hat got wet in the water. He had to leave it on the beach to dry. Eventually Steve and his horse got hot. They rode east again. \n\nEventually Steve arrived back at his farm. This confused him because he thought he had been riding in a different direction. Steve learned that there really was no place like home. He put his horse in the barn and went back into his house.",

      "story": "A public high school in the rural town of Boonsboro,Maryland,offers a special program recently. Top students in the ninth and tenth grades can attend single-sex classes for math,science,English and social studies. \n\nThe aim is to help teenagers keep their mind on their work by keeping males and females apart. Rebecca Brown chooses the students for what Boonsboro High School calls the Academy. \"What we really want to do is take that top group of kids and take them to the very highest level they can achieve here,so that they're prepared for college,\" she said. They need high marks and test scores and strong teacher recommendations. They also need to be involved in activities. \n\nMichael Bair has been at Boonsboro High School for twenty years and directs the Academy. His ninth-grade English class for boys centers on books that he believes boys find interesting. \"The novels they're reading now,are very manly novels. They're novels that deal with the arrogance of man and the pride of man.\" One of those books,for example,is \"The Call of the Wild\" by Jack London. This classic story tells of a dog stolen from his home and sold to work as a sled dog in Canada's Klondike Gold Rush. \n\nOn this day,the students are working in small groups. Vincent and Logan explain why they're drawing pictures that relate to the story. Vincent said,\"The main character,Buck,gets abducted , and they send him off to the Yukon in a train. So I'm drawing part of the story where he's in the train. It gets you to _ the setting of the story and gets you to think more about what's going on in the story,the important events of the story.\"\" Instead of just doing work sheets about it,this is a lot more fun,\" Logan added happily. \n\nMorgan Van Fleet likes being in the Academy. She says boys and girls act differently when they are together in a classroom. \"To me,it almost seems like it's hindering your chances at developing yourself because you're more focused on 'Oh,I wish they'd shut up. Oh,what do they think of me?' instead of focusing on what's the homework or what's going on in this class,what's the lesson.\"",

The Duke had especially asked both Mrs. Finn and Lady Mabel to remain, the former, through his anxiety to show his repentance for the injustice he had formerly done her, and the latter in the hope that something might be settled as soon as the crowd of visitors should have gone. He had never spoken quite distinctly to Mabel. He had felt that the manner in which he had learned his son's purpose,--that which once had been his son's purpose,--forbade him to do so. But he had so spoken as to make Lady Mabel quite aware of his wish. He would not have told her how sure he was that Silverbridge would keep no more racehorses, how he trusted that Silverbridge had done with betting, how he believed that the young member would take a real interest in the House of Commons, had he not intended that she should take a special interest in the young man. And then he had spoken about the house in London. It was to be made over to Silverbridge as soon as Silverbridge should marry. And there was Gatherum Castle. Gatherum was rather a trouble than otherwise. He had ever felt it to be so, but had nevertheless always kept it open perhaps for a month in the year. His uncle had always resided there for a fortnight at Christmas. When Silverbridge was married it would become the young man's duty to do something of the same kind. Gatherum was the White Elephant of the family, and Silverbridge must enter in upon his share of the trouble. He did not know that in saying all this he was offering his son as a husband to Lady Mabel, but she understood it as thoroughly as though he had spoken the words. ",

      "story": "When your pet meets your infant, it might not be love at first sniff. \n\nBaby's Best Friend \n\nWhen Jennifer Merritt brought her baby, Arielle, home from the hospital, her cherished dogs had very different reactions. Her boxer, Sonya, was immediately gentle and protective. But Tiger, the Pomeranian, was less welcoming: \"If any diapers or toys were on the floor, he peed on them!\"says the Greenbrier, prefix = st1 /Arkansas, mom. Tiger isn't the first dog to feel jealous of a baby. In the eyes of a pet's, there's a new star in town who's stealing his spotlight. Even the most gentle animal will probably act up if he doesn't get his usual attention. These simple steps will help your pet adjust -- and keep your baby safe. \n\nu Introduce Them with Care \n\nYour newborn and pet's first encounter can set the tone for their relationship. To make it as smooth as possible, try this trick from Caryn Ruiz, of Raleigh, North Carolina: \"Before we left the hospital, my husband took blankets home to our dog, Daisy, so she'd know our newborn Devon's smell.\" When you get home, have your husband carry the baby so you can greet your pet without worrying about her jumping on you. A cat will likely walk away at first, while a dog will probably want to investigate right away. \n\nTo introduce your baby, get down on your pet's level and let her have a hello sniff. Don't panic and pull your newborn away unless your pet is barking or hissing, because it'll send the message that the baby is a threat. \n\nu Learn the Safety Basics \n\nNo matter how smoothly the introduction goes, there are certain safety rules you should follow, says Bonnie Beaver, DVM, past president of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Number one: Never leave your baby alone with the pet. Even the gentlest animal can react unpredictably. Your baby's crying could frighten your cat, or your dog could suddenly become territorial. Consider setting up baby gates to limit your pet's access. To keep your cat from jumping into the bassinet , try putting mosquito netting over the top. Cats hate sticky paws, so keep the crib and changing table off-limits by lining the edges with sticky strips made for furniture (available in most pet stores).

Forward march!\" \n\nCaptain Jack Rover, assisted by Lieutenant Fred Rover and his other officers, was drilling Company C in a corner of the gymnasium of Colby Hall. It was two days after the adventure on the Rick Rack River, and it was still raining, so that drilling in the open was almost out of the question. \n\nThe four cadets who had taken part in the rescue of John Franklin and his son Phil had explained the situation to Captain Dale on their return to the school and had been warmly praised by that old West Point military man for their bravery. \n\nIt may be mentioned here that Captain Dale had been in charge of the school since Colonel Colby had volunteered for the war and gone to France to fight. \n\nMany of the cadets hated the rain and hoped it would soon clear. They loved drilling in the open far more than when held indoors, and they also wished to get at baseball and other Spring sports. \n\n\"It's a shame it doesn't let up,\" remarked Gif Garrison, after the drilling had come to an end and the rifles had been put away in their cases along the wall. Gif was a big youth, and the recognized head of many of the athletic sports. \n\n\"Well, we have to take such matters as they come,\" returned Spouter Powell, running his hand through his heavy brush of hair. \"Were it not for the gentle rains, and the dews later on, the fields and slopes of the hills would not be clothed in the verdant green which all true lovers of nature so much admire.

      "story": "Affirmative action in the United States tends to focus on issues such as education and employment, specifically granting special consideration to racial minorities, Native Americans, and women who have been historically excluded groups in America. Reports have shown that minorities and women have faced discrimination in schools and businesses for many years and this discrimination produced unfair advantages for whites and males in education and employment. The impetus toward affirmative action is redressing the disadvantages associated with past and present discrimination. Further impetus is a desire to ensure public institutions, such as universities, hospitals, and police forces, are more representative of the populations they serve. \n\nAffirmative action is a subject of controversy. Some policies adopted as affirmative action, such as racial quotas or gender quotas for collegiate admission, have been criticized as a form of reverse discrimination, and such implementation of affirmative action has been ruled unconstitutional by the majority opinion of Gratz v. Bollinger. Affirmative action as a practice was upheld by the Supreme Court's decision in Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003. Affirmative action policies were developed in order to correct decades of discrimination stemming from the Reconstruction Era by granting disadvantaged minorities opportunities. Many believe that the diversity of current American society suggests that affirmative action policies succeeded and are no longer required. Opponents of affirmative action argue that these policies are outdated and lead to reverse discrimination which entails favoring one group over another based upon racial preference rather than achievement.",

He knows from experience what it means, as the Portuguese film director has reached the age of 102 and is still active in his profession. Every year, Oliveira shoots a film and is currently working on his next project. \"You have to work, work, work in order to forget that death is not far away,\" he said. When asked about his age, Oliveira said with some humility: \"It's down to mother nature. It gave to me what it took from others.\" \n\nBeing both mentally and physically fit in old age is partly a matter of luck, but it also has something to do with character. Not every white-haired person is wise and social skills, openness and the ability to train the brain are essential for senior citizens. \n\nAlong with the architect Oscar Niemeyer (103), Nobel laureate Montalcini (101) and director Kurt Maetzig (100), Oliveira is one of those people of whom it would be very wrong to think as members of a listless elderly generation. \n\nAnother master in his profession is the architect Oscar Niemeyer. The 103-year-old Brazilian is best known for his futuristic-looking buildings in Brasilia, but he also speaks out on behalf of the poor. \"The role of the architect is to struggle for a better world where we can develop a form of architecture that serves everyone and not just a privileged few,\" said Niemeyer recently. He spends almost every day working in his office in Copacabana, and even when he falls ill he keeps working on ideas: After a gallbladder operation he composed a samba tune in the clinic. \n\nAnother man who could sing a song about age is 107-year-old Heesters. The Dutch-born opera singer spent most of his life performing in Germany, where he still works. Recently Heesters said: \"I want to be at least 108-years-old.\" He also plans to keep performing. \" _ \" Heesters has not given up trying to add to his tally of awards and is looking for a \"good stage role\". \n\nItalian scientist Rita Levi-Montalcini, who is 101-year-old and is still active in medical science, has described the force that keeps driving her on: \"Progress is created through imperfection.\" In 1986 she and her lab colleague were awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their work on nerve growth factor. She's convinced that humans grow on challenges. \n\nWith so many brilliant examples given, we can see clearly that age is no barrier to some high achievers.",

It was Werner just as sure as I am standing here. I just happened to glance out of the window and saw him crossing the roadway. He turned his face straight toward me, and I couldn't help but recognize him.\" \n\n\"Where did he go?\" \n\n\"I'll point out the place when we get there.\" \n\nBy this time the four Rovers had left the boardwalk and were plowing along on the side of the road through mud that varied from an inch to six inches in depth. They had started to run, but were soon compelled to slow up. \n\n\"Gee, this is something fierce!\" panted Andy. \n\n\"Oh, you cinder path!\" chanted his twin. \"Wouldn't you like to do a hundred-yard dash on this road?\" \n\n\"It's not much farther,\" announced Jack. \"I saw him heading for that shack yonder.\" \n\nThe place he mentioned was a small building erected of rough boards, with a galvanized roof. They neared the shack to find two men sitting before it on a log smoking their pipes. They appeared somewhat startled. ",

Thus, early on Monday, a party of about thirty set forth on horseback, including the Ribaumonts, Rayonette being perched by turns in front of her father or mother, and the Duke de Quinet declaring that he should do his best to divide the journey into stages not too long for Philip, since he was anxious to give his mother plenty of time to make preparations for her royal guest. \n\nHe had, however, little reckoned on the young King's promptitude. The first courier he had dispatched was overtaken at a _cabaret_ only five leagues from Pont de Dronne, baiting his horse, as he said; the second was found on the road with a lame horse; and the halt a day's journey remained beyond it. The last stage had been ridden, much to the Duke's discontent, for it brought them to a mere village inn, with scarcely any accommodation. The only tolerable bed was resigned by the King to the use of Philip, whose looks spoke the exhaustion of which his tongue scorned to complain. So painful and feverish a night ensued that Eustacie was anxious that he should not move until the Duke should, as he promised, send a mule litter back for him; but this proposal he resented; and in the height of his constitutional obstinacy, appeared booted and spurred at the first signal to mount.

He never lost his baby teeth, never grew taller than about 30 inches and never weighed more than 28 pounds. They did estimate, however, that he would not live to see his 12th birthday. \n\nAs a boy I learned to feed and clothe Mike. As a teenager, I babysat for my \"big brother\" and learned use the proper medicine to prevent the seizures that caused him to tremble. \n\nMany people said he would never walk or talk . He never did learn to walk, but he did learn to talk --not even in complete sentences, but he had the basics down. If he was hungry, thirsty, happy or sad, we knew. He knew names too. I was Kagun, not Kevin. But that changed with a beard I grew during the summer before college. Family members said it was ugly. Mike heard it. \n\n\"Look who's at home. Who's that?\" they'd say to Mike. \"Ugly,\" he would respond with delight. \n\nAll of which--to me--was normal, for he was the only brother I knew. The only time I thought of the differences between us was when others pointed them out. \n\nMy circle of friends widened when I entered high school.

It was a very even match. My motivation is there always, especially when I'm playing finals of such a big event.\" \n\nThe 26-year-old was winning his 20th straight match on Chinese soil and he improved to 62-9 for the season.

      "story": "A pastor is usually an ordained leader of a Christian congregation. When used as an ecclesiastical styling or title, the term may be abbreviated to \"Pr\" or \"Ptr\" (singular) or \"Ps\" (plural). A pastor also gives advice and counsel to people from the community or congregation. It is derrived from the Latin word, \"pascere\", meaning fed or grazed. \n\nThe word \"pastor\" derives from the Latin noun which means \"shepherd\" and relates to the Latin verb - \"to lead to pasture, set to grazing, cause to eat\". The term \"pastor\" also relates to the role of elder within the New Testament, but is not synonymous with the biblical understanding of minister. Many Protestant churches call their ministers \"pastors\". \n\nPresent-day usage of the word is rooted in the Biblical image of shepherding. The Hebrew Bible (or Old Testament) uses the Hebrew word (\"ra\u02bfah\") which means shepherd. It occurs 173 times and relates to the feeding of sheep, as in Genesis 29:7, or to the spiritual feeding of human beings, as in Jeremiah 3:15, \"Then I will give you shepherds after My own heart, who will feed you on knowledge and understanding\" (NASB). English-language translations of the New Testament usually render the Greek noun (\"poim\u0113n\") as \"shepherd\" and the Greek verb (\"poimaino\") as \"to shepherd\". The two words occur a total of 29 times in the New Testament, most frequently referring to Jesus. For example, Jesus called himself the \"Good Shepherd\" in John 10:11. The same words in the familiar Christmas story (Luke 2) refer to literal shepherds.",

Tarwala accidentally pooped on the door mat because he did not make it to the bathroom in time, but he still did not stop eating strange things. \n\nOne day, Tarwala got in trouble at the zoo for trying to eat lettuce along with the big cats. His parents felt that they needed to help Tarwala fix his problem. His dad had a great idea, and he needed one month to do it. One month later, his dad took off his sock and put it in front of Tarwala. Tarwala immediately ate the sock like he always did, but something special happened. Tarwala saw bright lights and passed out. It turns out that Tarwala's dad did not change his sock or wash his toes for the whole month. The stink was so powerful that it got magical. The magical stink changed Tarwala's mouth, brain, and stomach to help him tell the difference between real food and things that were not food. Tarwala started to eat like a normal child and he lived a good life.",

Luke Ravenstahl, cashing in on his family's political tradition, is already the mayor of Pittsburgh, the youngest mayor of any major city in the country. Although mayors elsewhere have been younger, Jeff Dunkel was 18 in 2001 when he was elected mayor of Mount Carbon, small towns inNew York, and elsewhere have also elected teenagers as mayors. But,Tallahassee, is the only other city with a population over 100,000 that has had a mayor as young as Mr. Ravenstahl. A supporter of Mr. Ravenstahl said concerns about Mr. Ravenstahl's age would _ once the city saw his work ethic. But now comes the hard part. As he strives to be taken seriously and take charge of a city only recently back from the brink of bankruptcy, the baby-faced mayor said that even the smallest decisions felt weighty, even what to wear in the Steelers game matters. And another pressing issue is to strengthen the city's economy. Pittsburghhas lost all its mills, nearly half its population and much of its downtown commercial district in the last several decades. \"ButPittsburghhas 50,000 college students, and our challenge is to figure out how to retain them and to increase downtown development.\" He said. But one of the biggest uncertainties is how long he will remain in office. According to the city charter, Mayor Ravenstahl's term will not expire until November 2009. Some city lawyers, however, have argued that he must face the electorate next year. And residents in Pittsburghare still withholding judgment on him. Deli, Jimmy Cvetic, a sandwich shop owner, said \"I call him Cool Hand Luke. He'll be all right, but he's going to need a cool hand to get through this.\" Mayor Ravenstahl said he was still coming to terms with the challenge he faced.",

      "story": "(CNN) -- The mayor of a Montana college town Wednesday welcomed a federal investigation into allegations that sexual assault and rape complaints were improperly handled. \n\nBut John Engen, mayor since 2006, was also surprised when he was notified of the probe. \n\n\"This is uncharted territory for us,\" he told CNN. \n\nThe U.S. Justice Department announced Tuesday it was launching a probe into allegations that up to 80 complaints of sexual assault over three years were not investigated thoroughly because of gender bias. Of those, 11 cases involved students at the University of Montana -- at least two involving football players. \n\n\"If Justice has enough information that it believes an investigation is warranted, I'm not going to question that,\" Engen said. \"Clearly they have a responsibility to act on whatever complaints they are hearing. I think time will tell whether this was the right call or not.\" \n\nAssistant Attorney General Thomas Perez of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division said the focus of the investigation was not on the number of reported allegations, but on the response. \n\n\"Our focus is on systemic issues; that is, do the university and the law enforcement agencies have the necessary policies and practices in place to protect women in a comprehensive and integrated manner,\" Perez said at a news conference Tuesday. \n\nThe Department of Education is coordinating with Justice officials, a spokesman told CNN. \n\nFred Van Valkenburg, Missoula County chief prosecutor, vehemently defended his office and the police officers involved in the investigations. \n\n\"We adamantly deny that we have done any such thing, and we are deeply disturbed with the allegation that we have done so,\" he told reporters.

He had done his homework, paid attention to lectures, and taken notes, but nothing was familiar. \"Everyone is so much cleverer than I am,\" he thought. It was a strange feeling, as he was always a good student in high school. He felt even more puzzled a few days later. He got lost on his way to his favorite cinema. What's worse, he began having trouble finding the right words when speaking. He asked, \"What's for dinner, Mom?\" after he had just eaten. Poor Andrew, he was only 15! His parents were worried and took Andrew to see a doctor. A brain scan made it clear: Andrew had a malignant brain tumor . It was pressing on the part of the brain that makes new memory. He should be operated on as soon as possible. Andrew was _ ! Doctors removed the tumor, but Andrew's memory was still poor. He was told he would probably never go back to school. Andrew was eager to enter a university, but it seemed that his dream wouldn't come true. \"Even though they told me this, I knew I wanted to go back to school,\" Andrew said. \"I wanted to get my memory back.\" Andrew began by auditing an English class at a nearby school. In class, he took notes carefully and read his notes several times a day, then typed them again and again. He studied twelve hours a day, seven days a week. He worked ten times harder than other students. In 2007, at age 29, he graduated from a local university. Six months later, Andrew found a job.",

We could see the smile on his face when we talked to him. I missed him a lot. When Ryan came home again that Monday, it was the best day of my life! We went to the airport to pick him up. He had a long trip. It took many days for him to travel back home. He left the Army base 4 days before he finally got home. He was glad to sleep in his own room again. He let me camp out in his room. We stayed up late talking in whispers. He told me stories about the Army. Mom let me miss school the next day. I spent the whole day with my brother. He likes to chase me around and tickle me when he catches me. He lets me ride on his shoulders. I like to ride in his truck. I like to watch TV with him. We went on adventures. We laughed a lot. Ryan's visit went by too fast. Soon, it was time for him to go back. He left for the Army on Friday. It was a long way for him to ride in the airplane. He got back on Tuesday. I can't wait to see him again. Next time, we'll visit him on vacation. I want to see the Army trucks and helicopters.",

But he had no sooner taken his place in the library than he sent for her. He had been thinking about it all the way down from London, and had in some sort prepared his words. During the next half hour he did promise himself some pleasure, after that his life was to be altogether a blank to him. He would go. To that only had he made up his mind. He would tell Mary that she should be happy. He would make Mrs Baggett understand that for the sake of his property she must remain at Croker's Hall for some period to which he would decline to name an end. And then he would go. \n\n\"Well, Mary,\" he said, smiling, \"so I have got back safe.\" \n\n\"Yes; I see you have got back.\" \n\n\"I saw a friend of yours when I was up in London.\" \n\n\"I have had a letter, you know, from Mr Gordon.\" \n\n\"He has written, has he?

Luke Ravenstahl, cashing in on his family's political tradition, is already the mayor of Pittsburgh, the youngest mayor of any major city in the country. Although mayors elsewhere have been younger, Jeff Dunkel was 18 in 2001 when he was elected mayor of Mount Carbon, small towns inNew York, and elsewhere have also elected teenagers as mayors. But,Tallahassee, is the only other city with a population over 100,000 that has had a mayor as young as Mr. Ravenstahl. A supporter of Mr. Ravenstahl said concerns about Mr. Ravenstahl's age would _ once the city saw his work ethic. But now comes the hard part. As he strives to be taken seriously and take charge of a city only recently back from the brink of bankruptcy, the baby-faced mayor said that even the smallest decisions felt weighty, even what to wear in the Steelers game matters. And another pressing issue is to strengthen the city's economy. Pittsburghhas lost all its mills, nearly half its population and much of its downtown commercial district in the last several decades. \"ButPittsburghhas 50,000 college students, and our challenge is to figure out how to retain them and to increase downtown development.\" He said. But one of the biggest uncertainties is how long he will remain in office. According to the city charter, Mayor Ravenstahl's term will not expire until November 2009. Some city lawyers, however, have argued that he must face the electorate next year. And residents in Pittsburghare still withholding judgment on him. Deli, Jimmy Cvetic, a sandwich shop owner, said \"I call him Cool Hand Luke. He'll be all right, but he's going to need a cool hand to get through this.\" Mayor Ravenstahl said he was still coming to terms with the challenge he faced.",

They were particularly civil each to the other and went to work together, making arrangements at a bank as to their money, taking their places, despatching their luggage, and sorting their belongings as though there had been no such woman as Mrs. Smith on board the Goldfinder. Dick, though he had been inclined to grumble when his mystery had been taken out of his hands,--who had, of course, been jealous when he saw that the lady had discarded her old hat and put on new ribbons, not for him, but for another,--was too conscious of the desolation to which he would be subjected by quarrelling with his friend. He felt himself unable to go alone, and was therefore willing that the bygones of the ship should be bygones. Caldigate, on the other hand, acknowledged to himself that he owed some reparation to his companion. Of course he had not bound himself to any special mode of life;--but had he, in his present condition, allied himself more closely to Mrs. Smith, he would, to some extent, have thrown Dick over. And then, as soon as he was on shore, he did feel somewhat ashamed of himself in regard to Mrs. Smith. Was it not manifest that any closer alliance, let the alliance be what it might, must be ruinous to him? As it was, had he not made an absolute fool of himself with Mrs. Smith? Had he not got himself already into a mess from which there was no escape? Of course he must write to her when the month was over. The very weight of his thoughts on this matter made him tamer with Dick and more observant than he would otherwise have been. ",

He wrote more than 20,000 letters and more than 2,000 books and pamphlets. He was an outspoken advocate of civil liberties, despite the risk this placed him in under the strict censorship laws of the time. As a satirical polemicist, he frequently made use of his works to criticize intolerance, religious dogma, and the French institutions of his day. \n\nFran\u00e7ois-Marie Arouet was born in Paris, the youngest of the five children of Fran\u00e7ois Arouet (19 August 1649 \u2013 1 January 1722), a lawyer who was a minor treasury official, and his wife, Marie Marguerite Daumard (c. 1660 \u2013 13 July 1701), whose family was on the lowest rank of the French nobility. Some speculation surrounds Voltaire's date of birth, because he claimed he was born on 20 February 1694 as the illegitimate son of a nobleman, Gu\u00e9rin de Rochebrune or Roquebrune. Two of his older brothers\u2014Armand-Fran\u00e7ois and Robert\u2014died in infancy and his surviving brother, Armand, and sister Marguerite-Catherine were nine and seven years older, respectively. Nicknamed 'Zozo' by his family, Voltaire was baptized on 22 November 1694, with , and Marie Daumard, the wife of his mother's cousin, standing as godparents. He was educated by the Jesuits at the Coll\u00e8ge Louis-le-Grand (1704\u20131711), where he was taught Latin, theology, and rhetoric; later in life he became fluent in Italian, Spanish, and English.",

      "story": "British Women Writers in different periods of time The English Renaissance The English Renaissance began in the later part of the fifteenth century and lasted until the 1660s. Among the most famous women writers of this period is Aphra Behn, who is seen as the first professional woman writer in English. She wrote a number of plays that dealt with topics such as racism and slavery. A good example isOroonokopublished in 1688. Aphra Behn's works include also the playsThe Amourous Prince,The Town Fop, The Dutch Loverand her only tragedy,Abdelazer. The neoclassical period Among the well-known women in Bristish literature during the neoclassical period, from 1660 to the end of the eighteenth century, is Anne Finch. She wrote poetry and tried to express all that she saw and experienced. Two other women are recognized for their contribution to neoclassical British literature: Mary Astell and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Mary Astell was a philosopher and a feminist writer. She is best known now for her theories on the education of women. The Romantic period Jane Austen is one of the most famous women writers that worked during the Romantic period (1798-1832). Her works include several novels, most of which focus on marriage as a way for young women to secure social standing and economic security. Her most famous novels arePride and Prejudice,Sense and SensibilityandEmma. Another famous woman writer from the English Romanticism is Mary Shelley. She is the author ofFrankenstein,History of Six Weeks TourandThe Last Man.

Charlotte Bronte, Emily Bronte and Anne Bronte produced many British literary classics. Charlotte's novels includeJane Eyre,Shirley,Villette and The Professor. Mary Anne Evans adopted the male pen name George as she wanted to set herself apart from the feminine genre of cookbooks and domestic moral tales.

      "story": "Kurdish is a continuum of Northwestern Iranian languages spoken by the Kurds in Western Asia. Kurdish forms three dialect groups known as Northern Kurdish (Kurmanji), Central Kurdish (Sorani), and Southern Kurdish (Palewani). A separate group of non-Kurdish Northwestern Iranian languages, the Zaza\u2013Gorani languages, are also spoken by several million Kurds. Studies as of 2009 estimate between 8 and 20 million native Kurdish speakers in Turkey. The majority of the Kurds speak Northern Kurdish (\"Kurmanji\"). \n\nThe literary output in Kurdish was mostly confined to poetry until the early 20th century, when more general literature began to be developed. Today, there are two principal written Kurdish dialects, namely Northern Kurdish in the northern parts of the geographical region of Kurdistan and Central Kurdish further east and south. Central Kurdish is, along with Arabic, one of the two official languages of Iraq and is in political documents simply referred to as \"Kurdish\". \n\nThe Kurdish languages belong to the Iranian branch of the Indo-European family. They are generally classified as Northwestern Iranian languages, or by some scholars as intermediate between Northwestern and Southwestern Iranian. Martin van Bruinessen notes that \"Kurdish has a strong south-western Iranian element\", whereas \"Zaza and Gurani [...] do belong to the north-west Iranian group\".",

It was the driving force behind the unification of Germany in 1871 and was the leading state of the German Empire until its dissolution in 1918. Although it took its name from the region called Prussia, it was based in the Margraviate of Brandenburg, where its capital was Berlin. \n\nThe kings of Prussia were from the House of Hohenzollern. Prussia was a great power from the time it became a kingdom, through its predecessor, Brandenburg-Prussia, which became a military power under Frederick William, known as \"The Great Elector\". Prussia continued its rise to power under the guidance of Frederick II, more commonly known as Frederick the Great, the third son of Frederick William I. Frederick the Great was instrumental in starting the Seven Years' War, holding his own against Austria, Russia, France and Sweden and establishing Prussia\u2019s role in the German states, as well as establishing the country as a European great power.

All her old men had been only too glad of the opportunity to come back to her, and under Dale and Roy Beeman a different and prosperous order marked the life of the ranch. \n\nHelen had made changes in the house by altering the arrangement of rooms and adding a new section. Only once had she ventured into the old dining-room where Las Vegas Carmichael had sat down to that fatal dinner for Beasley. She made a store-room of it, and a place she would never again enter. \n\nHelen was happy, almost too happy, she thought, and therefore made more than needful of the several bitter drops in her sweet cup of life. Carmichael had ridden out of Pine, ostensibly on the trail of the Mexicans who had executed Beasley's commands. The last seen of him had been reported from Show Down, where he had appeared red-eyed and dangerous, like a hound on a scent. Then two months had flown by without a word. \n\nDale had shaken his head doubtfully when interrogated about the cowboy's absence. It would be just like Las Vegas never to be heard of again. Also it would be more like him to remain away until all trace of his drunken, savage spell had departed from him and had been forgotten by his friends. Bo took his disappearance apparently less to heart than Helen. But Bo grew more restless, wilder, and more wilful than ever.

Its name is derived from \"Columbia\", a national personification of the United States, which is used as the studio's logo. In its early years, it was a minor player in Hollywood, but began to grow in the late 1920s, spurred by a successful association with director Frank Capra. With Capra and others, Columbia became one of the primary homes of the screwball comedy. In the 1930s, Columbia's major contract stars were Jean Arthur and Cary Grant. In the 1940s, Rita Hayworth became the studio's premier star and propelled their fortunes into the late 1950s. Rosalind Russell, Glenn Ford, and William Holden also became major stars at the studio. \n\nIt is one of the leading film studios in the world, and is a member of the \"Big Six\" major American film studios.

Connie loves looking around at the choir and seeing everyone so happy when she was performing. \"We've heard you got a new Guinness world record!\" I asked her. \"Yes! I am very proud.

      "story": "British Women Writers in different periods of time The English Renaissance The English Renaissance began in the later part of the fifteenth century and lasted until the 1660s. Among the most famous women writers of this period is Aphra Behn, who is seen as the first professional woman writer in English. She wrote a number of plays that dealt with topics such as racism and slavery. A good example isOroonokopublished in 1688. Aphra Behn's works include also the playsThe Amourous Prince,The Town Fop, The Dutch Loverand her only tragedy,Abdelazer. The neoclassical period Among the well-known women in Bristish literature during the neoclassical period, from 1660 to the end of the eighteenth century, is Anne Finch. She wrote poetry and tried to express all that she saw and experienced. Two other women are recognized for their contribution to neoclassical British literature: Mary Astell and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Mary Astell was a philosopher and a feminist writer. She is best known now for her theories on the education of women. The Romantic period Jane Austen is one of the most famous women writers that worked during the Romantic period (1798-1832). Her works include several novels, most of which focus on marriage as a way for young women to secure social standing and economic security. Her most famous novels arePride and Prejudice,Sense and SensibilityandEmma. Another famous woman writer from the English Romanticism is Mary Shelley. She is the author ofFrankenstein,History of Six Weeks TourandThe Last Man. The Victorian period The Victorian period, between the 1830s and 1900, was the time when the Bronte sisters, George Eliot and Elizabeth Gaskell lived and wrote. Charlotte Bronte, Emily Bronte and Anne Bronte produced many British literary classics. Charlotte's novels includeJane Eyre,Shirley,Villette and The Professor. Mary Anne Evans adopted the male pen name George as she wanted to set herself apart from the feminine genre of cookbooks and domestic moral tales. Her most famous novel isThe Mill on the Flosspublished in 1860.",

In medieval times, Merv was one of the great cities of the Islamic world and an important stop on the Silk Road, a caravan route used for trade with China until the mid-15th century.

It was the driving force behind the unification of Germany in 1871 and was the leading state of the German Empire until its dissolution in 1918. Although it took its name from the region called Prussia, it was based in the Margraviate of Brandenburg, where its capital was Berlin. \n\nThe kings of Prussia were from the House of Hohenzollern. Prussia was a great power from the time it became a kingdom, through its predecessor, Brandenburg-Prussia, which became a military power under Frederick William, known as \"The Great Elector\". Prussia continued its rise to power under the guidance of Frederick II, more commonly known as Frederick the Great, the third son of Frederick William I. Frederick the Great was instrumental in starting the Seven Years' War, holding his own against Austria, Russia, France and Sweden and establishing Prussia\u2019s role in the German states, as well as establishing the country as a European great power. After the might of Prussia was revealed it was considered as a major power among the German states. Throughout the next hundred years Prussia went on to win many battles, and many wars. It was because of its power that Prussia continuously tried to unify all the German states under its rule.",

      "story": "The term Reconstruction Era, in the context of the history of the United States, has two senses: the first covers the complete history of the entire country from 1865 to 1877 following the American Civil War (1861 to 1865); the second sense focuses on the attempted transformation of the Southern United States from 1863 to 1877, as directed by Congress, with the reconstruction of state and society. With the three Reconstruction Amendments, the era saw the first amendments to the U.S. Constitution in decades. \n\nThree visions of Civil War memory appeared during Reconstruction: the reconciliationist vision, which was rooted in coping with the death and devastation the war had brought; the white supremacist vision, which included terror and violence; and the emancipationist vision, which sought full freedom, citizenship and Constitutional equality for African Americans. \n\nPresidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson both took moderate positions designed to bring the South back into the union as quickly as possible, while Radical Republicans in Congress sought stronger measures to upgrade the rights of African Americans, including the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, while curtailing the rights of former Confederates, such as through the provisions of the Wade\u2013Davis Bill.

FBI Agent Michael Carazza testified that agents found 30 weapons inside the apartment, some of them hidden behind living room and bathroom walls. \n\nThe evidence photographs show several handguns, one automatic rifle and a hand grenade the FBI says was recovered after it arrested Bulger in late June at the small apartment only a few blocks from the beach. \n\nThe government also released a brief security camera video of Greig walking in and out of a local drugstore, picking up a prescription, prosecutors said, that was under an assumed name. Bulger and Greig were known in Santa Monica as Charles and Carol Gasko. \n\nOne neighbor, 88-year-old Catalina Schlank, told CNN that the couple was always friendly to her. But, she added, they refused to be listed as an emergency contact in the event Schlank became ill, and the only phone number they provided was one that was directed to an answering service. \n\nThe detention hearing was to determine whether Greig will be granted bail on charges of harboring a fugitive. During the hearing, her attorney, Kevin Reddington, told the judge that his client was a \"kind, gentle person\" who had a \"loving personality.\" For his part, Bulger had entered a plea of not guilty to 19 counts of murder.

They walked in silence; nobody had yet ventured to comment on the departed guest. \n\n\"Well?\" said Anne at last, turning with raised inquiring eyebrows to Denis. \n\n\"Well?\" It was time for someone to begin. \n\nDenis declined the invitation; he passed it on to Mr Scogan. \"Well?\" he said. \n\nMr. Scogan did not respond; he only repeated the question, \"Well?\" \n\nIt was left for Henry Wimbush to make a pronouncement. \"A very agreeable adjunct to the week-end,\" he said. His tone was obituary. \n\nThey had descended, without paying much attention where they were going, the steep yew-walk that went down, under the flank of the terrace, to the pool. The house towered above them, immensely tall, with the whole height of the built-up terrace added to its own seventy feet of brick facade.

They paused at the edge of the pool to look back. \n\n\"The man who built this house knew his business,\" said Denis. \"He was an architect.\" \n\n\"Was he?\" said Henry Wimbush reflectively. \"I doubt it.

Does the term destroy the confidence of young girls? \n\nThe campaign claims that terms like \"bossy\" are improperly applied to females, preventing schoolgirls from seeing themselves as future \"leaders\". From its first application, the word has been definitely connected more with women than with men. It first appeared in 1882, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, mentioning \"a lady manager who was extremely bossy\". As late as 2008, the word appeared in reference to females four times more often than males, claim the Ban Bossy campaigners. \"To me, the reference is always is association with women,\" says Helen Trim, director of Fresh Minds. \"I have three brothers and my family still call me 'bossy' today.\" Her father is the only other family member who could be considered in that way, says Trim, but nobody would ever call him so. \n\nSome educators recommend that the word should be reclaimed, rather than banned.\"But the thing with'bossy' is that there's an infantile element to it,\"says Sara Mills, professor at Sheffield University. \"You think of 'bossy' as being like a little kid who's claiming more than he has the right to claim.\" \n\nIt's not just\"bossy\"under fire.\"Pushy\"is another target. The implication is that women shouldn't present themselves as powerful and confident. Mills suggests, which some women are willing to listen to and accept. Trim points out that many modern female business role models are able to be bosses without being labeled'bossy'.And she rarely,if ever, hears the word used within her company. But she says that the damage may be dome much earlier in a woman's life.\"It does come about from those early teenage years.\"she says.\"I think it's impossible to ban a word, but if people are replacing it with words like'confidence'or'assertiveness',we would all be in a much better place.\"",

It is the kind described in Twain's book, \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,\" published in1876. \n\nIn that story, Tom has been told to paint the fence. He does not want to do it. But he acts as if the job is great fun. He tricks other boys into believing this. His trick is so successful that they agree to pay him money to let them finish his work. \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\" is considered one of the best books about an American boy's life in THE the1800s. \n\nTom Sawyer's good friend is Huckleberry, or \"Huck,\" Finn. Mark Twain tells this boy's story in \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\" Huck is a poor child, without a mother or home. His father drinks too much alcohol and beats him. \n\nHuck's situation has freed him from the restrictions of society. He explores in the woods and goes fishing. He stays out all night and does not go to school. He smokes tobacco. \n\nHuck runs away from home. He meets Jim, a black man who has escaped from slavery. They travel together on a raft made of wood down the Mississippi River. Huck describes the trip: \"It was lovely to live on the raft. Other places seem so cramped up and smothery, but a raft don't. You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft... Sometimes we'd have that whole river to ourselves for the longest time...

It is the capital city of Jiangsu province of People's Republic of China and the second largest city in East China, with a total population of 8,216,100, and legally the capital of Republic of China which lost the mainland during the civil war. The city whose name means \"Southern Capital\" has a prominent place in Chinese history and culture, having served as the capitals of various Chinese dynasties, kingdoms and republican governments dating from the 3rd century AD to 1949. Prior to the advent of pinyin romanization, Nanjing's city name was spelled as Nanking or Nankin. Nanjing has a number of other names, and some historical names are now used as names of districts of the city, and among them there is the name Jiangning (\u6c5f\u5be7), whose former character Jiang (\u6c5f, River) is the former part of the name Jiangsu and latter character Ning (\u5be7, simplified form \u5b81, Peace) is the short name of Nanjing. When being the capital of a state, for instance, ROC, Jing (\u4eac) is adopted as the abbreviation of Nanjing. Although as a city located in southern part of China becoming Chinese national capital as early as in Jin dynasty, the name Nanjing was designated to the city in Ming dynasty, about a thousand years later. Nanjing is particularly known as Jinling (\u91d1\u9675, literally meaning Gold Mountain) and the old name has been used since the Warring States Period in Zhou Dynasty.",

We're certainly playing well enough. We don't look like a team down the bottom at the minute. \n\n\"If we keep going the way we're going, we'll win more games than not.

She was the only person at the park. \"How strange, where is everyone?\" she thought. Martha looked everywhere. She looked inside the restrooms, under the benches, and even at the top of the slide. She was confused. Usually, she would see her friends playing with each other. She started walking again when one of her friends popped up, surprising her. Her friend asked her, \"Why are you outside?\" Martha asked what she meant, and explained that she always came out to the park to play. Her friend then looked at her strangely and asked, \"Didn't Stephan invite you to his party?\" Martha hadn't known that Stephan was holding a party. She was sad that he hadn't invited her.

David Berger has provided several principles of document writing, regarding the terms used, procedure numbering and even lengths of sentences, etc. \n\nThe following is a list of guides dealing with each specific field and type: \n\nThe procedures of documentation vary from one sector, or one type, to another. In general, these may involve document drafting, formatting, submitting, reviewing, approving, distributing, reposting and tracking, etc., and are convened by associated SOPs in a regulatory industry. It could also involve creating content from scratch. Documentation should be easy to read and understand. If it's too long and too wordy, it may be misunderstood or ignored. Clear, Short, Familiar words should be used to a maximum of 15 words to a sentence. Only gender hyper neutral word should be used and cultural biases should be avoided.

Professional investment managers generally are compensated based on the volume of client assets under management. There is, therefore, an incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management in order to maximize their compensation. As the glut in global investment capital caused the yields on credit assets to decline, asset managers were faced with the choice of either investing in assets where returns did not reflect true credit risk or returning funds to clients. Many asset managers chose to continue to invest client funds in over-priced (under-yielding) investments, to the detriment of their clients, in order to maintain their assets under management. This choice was supported by a \"plausible deniability\" of the risks associated with subprime-based credit assets because the loss experience with early \"vintages\" of subprime loans was so low.",

      "story": "Bringing a giraffe into the world is _ . A baby giraffe is born 10 feet high and usually lands on its back. Within seconds it rolls over its legs under its body. Then the mother giraffe rudely introduces its children to the reality of life. In his book,A View from the Zoo, Gary Richmond describes how a new-born giraffe learns its first lesson. The mother giraffe lowers her head long enough to take a quick look. Then she puts herself directly over her child. She waits for about a minute, and then she does the most unreasonable thing. She throws her long leg and kicks her baby, so that it's sent sprawling . When it doesn't get up, the process is repeated again and again. The struggle to rise is important. As the baby giraffe grows tired, the mother kicks it again. Finally, it stands for the first time on its shaky legs. Then the mother giraffe kicks it off its feet again. Why? She wants it to remember how it got up. In the wild, a baby giraffe must be able to get up as quickly as possible to stay with its group, where there's safety. Another writer named Irving Stone understood this. He spent a lifetime studying greatness, writing stories about such men as Michelangelo, Vincent van Gogh, Sigmund Freud, and Charles Darwin. Stone was once asked if he had found something that runs through the lives of all these great people. He said, \"I write about people who sometime in their life have a dream of something. They're beaten over the head, knocked down and for years they get nowhere. But every time they stand up again. And at the end of their lives they've realized some small parts of what they set out to do .\"",

(commonly known as Columbia Pictures and Columbia, and formerly CBC Film Sales Corporation) is an American film studio, production company and film distributor that is a member of the Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, a division of Sony Entertainment's Sony Pictures subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate Sony. \n\nWhat would eventually become Columbia Pictures, CBC Film Sales Corporation, was founded on June 19, 1918 by Harry Cohn, his brother Jack Cohn, and Joe Brandt. It adopted the Columbia Pictures name in 1924, and went public two years later. Its name is derived from \"Columbia\", a national personification of the United States, which is used as the studio's logo. In its early years, it was a minor player in Hollywood, but began to grow in the late 1920s, spurred by a successful association with director Frank Capra. With Capra and others, Columbia became one of the primary homes of the screwball comedy. In the 1930s, Columbia's major contract stars were Jean Arthur and Cary Grant. In the 1940s, Rita Hayworth became the studio's premier star and propelled their fortunes into the late 1950s. Rosalind Russell, Glenn Ford, and William Holden also became major stars at the studio. \n\nIt is one of the leading film studios in the world, and is a member of the \"Big Six\" major American film studios. It was one of the so-called \"Little Three\" among the eight major film studios of Hollywood's Golden Age. Today, it has become the world's fifth largest major film studio.",

One of the fierce summer storms which sometimes sweep over the gulf was ravaging the sea.

This is because time travels more slowly in space, a phenomenon first described by Albert Einstein's 1915 theory of general relativity. \n\nThis December, universities and academies around the world are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the theory's publication. \n\nEven 60 years after his death, Einstein is still the most important scientist of the modern era. Looking back as far as 2,400 years ago, only Newton, Galileo and Aristotle were his equals. \n\nBorn in the era of horse-drawn carriages, his ideas started a technological revolution that brought about more change in one century than in the 2,000 years before. \n\nIn 1905, Einstein published four important scientific papers. These completely changed people's ideas about space, time, light and matter. In one of these papers Einstein. introduced his theory of special relativity. Two groundbreaking parts of the theory were about the relationship between mass and energy and the speed of light. Einstein was able to show that mass and energy were connected through the formula E=MC2. The theory also says that no object can travel faster than the speed of light. \n\nAbout 10 years later came his theory of general relativity, the theory that modern physics is really based on. In Einstein's mathematics, space has three dimensions, and the fourth dimension is time. Space and time are part of one continuum, called space-time. The presence of mass changes space-time, which explains where gravity comes from. \n\nComputers, satellites, telecommunication, lasers, television and nuclear power, many of the biggest developments in the modern world, can be linked to Einstein's work. \n\n\"We are a different people than we were a century ago,\" said astrophysicist Michael Shara of the American Museum of Natural. History, \"completely different, because of Einstein.\" \n\nHowever, there's more to him beyond the image of a science mastermind. Einstein, as a person, has also become a grandfatherly icon in our culture. \n\nHe liked playing Mozart on his Violin and keeping fit by hiking and walking. Power was not his goal. In 1952, the young nation of Israel asked Einstein to be its president, but he refused. \n\nAnd, yes, he was eccentric. With hair like that, how could he not be?",

      "story": "It was in 1865 that two Frenchmen were looking into the future. Edouard de Laboulaye, who studied history, admired the United States greatly. Frederic Auguste Bartholdi was a famous artist. De Laboulaye was thinking about 1876, when the country he respected so much would celebrate its 100th birthday. What gift would be good enough for the people of France to give? Right away, Bartholdi thought of a giant statue. \n\nBartholdi kept thinking about a statue for several years. Then, in 1871, he visited the United States and saw the perfect place for a huge statue. It was Bedloe's Island in New York. \n\nThe project -- the Statue of Liberty -- got started almost immediately, and Bartholdi went home to France to begin work. However, the statue was not finished in time for the 100th birthday. The United States Congress approved the use of Bedloe's Island on February 22, 1877. During the 100th celebration in 1876, the arm of the statue that would hold the torch was shown in Philadelphia. In 1879 the huge head was put on display in France. For the face of the statue, Bartholdi used his mother as a model. \n\nThe statue was finally completed in 1884. The work had been difficult enough, but then some really hard work began. The statue had to be taken apart and packed into boxes. It was not until May 1885 that the statue -- in pieces -- left France for its new home. \n\nThe statue arrived in June. However, the Americans fell behind on their part of the project. They hadn't raised enough money for building the base of the statue. People wondered if the country really needed or wanted such a gift. Finally, though, the money was raised and the base was completed. The last piece of the statue was put in place on October 28, 1886.",

The mainstream Hindu philosophy includes six systems (\u1e63a\u1e0ddar\u015bana) \u2013 Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Mimamsa and Vedanta. These are also called the Astika (orthodox) philosophical traditions and are those that accept the Vedas as authoritative, important source of knowledge.[note 1][note 2] Ancient and medieval India was also the source of philosophies that share philosophical concepts but rejected the Vedas, and these have been called n\u0101stika (heterodox or non-orthodox) Indian philosophies. N\u0101stika Indian philosophies include Buddhism, Jainism, C\u0101rv\u0101ka, \u0100j\u012bvika, and others. \n\nScholars have debated the relationship and differences within \u0101stika philosophies and with n\u0101stika philosophies, starting with the writings of Indologists and Orientalists of the 18th and 19th centuries, which were themselves derived from limited availability of Indian literature and medieval doxographies. The various sibling traditions included in Hindu philosophies are diverse, and they are united by shared history and concepts, same textual resources, similar ontological and soteriological focus, and cosmology. While Buddhism and Jainism are considered distinct philosophies and religions, some heterodox traditions such as C\u0101rv\u0101ka are often considered as distinct schools within Hindu philosophy.",

This is because time travels more slowly in space, a phenomenon first described by Albert Einstein's 1915 theory of general relativity. \n\nThis December, universities and academies around the world are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the theory's publication. \n\nEven 60 years after his death, Einstein is still the most important scientist of the modern era. Looking back as far as 2,400 years ago, only Newton, Galileo and Aristotle were his equals. \n\nBorn in the era of horse-drawn carriages, his ideas started a technological revolution that brought about more change in one century than in the 2,000 years before. \n\nIn 1905, Einstein published four important scientific papers. These completely changed people's ideas about space, time, light and matter. In one of these papers Einstein. introduced his theory of special relativity. Two groundbreaking parts of the theory were about the relationship between mass and energy and the speed of light. Einstein was able to show that mass and energy were connected through the formula E=MC2. The theory also says that no object can travel faster than the speed of light. \n\nAbout 10 years later came his theory of general relativity, the theory that modern physics is really based on. In Einstein's mathematics, space has three dimensions, and the fourth dimension is time. Space and time are part of one continuum, called space-time. The presence of mass changes space-time, which explains where gravity comes from. \n\nComputers, satellites, telecommunication, lasers, television and nuclear power, many of the biggest developments in the modern world, can be linked to Einstein's work. \n\n\"We are a different people than we were a century ago,\" said astrophysicist Michael Shara of the American Museum of Natural. History, \"completely different, because of Einstein.\" \n\nHowever, there's more to him beyond the image of a science mastermind. Einstein, as a person, has also become a grandfatherly icon in our culture. \n\nHe liked playing Mozart on his Violin and keeping fit by hiking and walking. Power was not his goal. In 1952, the young nation of Israel asked Einstein to be its president, but he refused. \n\nAnd, yes, he was eccentric. With hair like that, how could he not be?",

Being the oldest domesticated animal, their long association with people has allowed dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior, as well as thrive on a starch-rich diet which would be inadequate for other canid species. \n\nDogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship, and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals. This impact on human society has given them the nickname \"man's best friend\" in the Western world. In some cultures, however, dogs are a source of meat.",

CNN takes a closer look at the first U.S.-born player of Chinese or Taiwanese descent to play in the NBA, and how he's becoming more popular with every game. \n\nWho is Jeremy Lin? \n\nBorn to parents Shirley and Gie-Ming on August 23, 1988, Lin is an Asian-American NBA player for the New York Knicks. He wears the jersey No. 17 and plays as point guard. As a professional basketballer he's not overly tall, measuring 6 feet, 3 inches (191 centimeters) and weighs 200 pounds (90.7 kilograms). He played for four years at Harvard, and has spent just one year as a professional player. \n\nCareer highlights: \n\nFollowing his stint at Harvard (where he was twice named to the all-Ivy League), Lin failed to get drafted by an NBA franchise, and instead signed as a free agent with the Golden State Warriors in July, 2010. In December 2011, Lin signed with the New York Knicks after being cut by the Houston Rockets. His 109 points in his first four starts this past week have surpassed Allen Iverson's to become the most by any player since the NBA-ABA merger in 1976. \n\n'Linsanity': Why the hype? \n\nEveryone loves a battle-against-the-odds story, and Lin fits the bill perfectly. The reasons for his meteoric rise to become a U.S. basketball sensation are numerous, but it all starts with talent. In just weeks he's gone from one-time bench-warmer to team savior, leading the Knicks to five straight victories and averaging more than 20 points per game, while his field goal percentage during this winning streak tops 50%. In Friday's game against Kobe Bryant's L.A. Lakers, he reeled off 38 points in that victory alone. ",

      "story": "I call my story the story of a bad boy, partly to distinguish myself from those faultless young gentlemen, and partly because I really was not an angle. I may truthfully say I was a friendly, impulsive teenager. I didn't want to be an angel. In short, I was a real human boy, such as you may meet anywhere in New England. \n\nWhenever a new scholar came to our school, I used to ask him \" My name's Tom Bailey; what's your name?\" If the name struck me favorably, I shook hands with the new pupil _ , but if it didn't, I would turn and walk away, for I was particular on this point. \n\nI was born in Rivermouth almost fifty years ago, but, before I became very well acquainted with that pretty New England town, my parents moved to New Orleans. I was only eighteen months old at the time of the move, and it didn't make much difference to me where I was, because several years later, when my father proposed to take me North to be educated, I had my own view on the subject. I instantly kicked over the little boy, Sam, who happened to be standing by me at the moment, and declared that I would not be taken away to live among a lot of Yankees! You see I was what is called \" a Northern man with Southern principles,\" I had no recollection of New England: my earliest memories were connected with the South. I knew I was born in the North, but hoped nobody would find it out. I never told my schoolmates I was a Yankee, because they talked about Yankees in a scornful way which made me feel that it was quite a shame not to be born in the South. \n\nAnd this impression was strengthened by Aunt Chloe, who said, \"There wasn't no gentlemen in the North no way.\" \n\nWith this picture of Northern civilization in my eye, the readers will easily understand my terror at the bare thought of being transported to Rivermouth to school, and possibly will forgive me for kicking over little Sam, when my father announced this to me. As for kicking little Sam, I always did that, more or less gently, when anything went wrong with me. \n\nMy father was greatly troubled by this violent behavior. As little Sam picked himself up, my father took my hand in his and led me thoughtfully to the library. He appeared strangely puzzled on learning the nature of my objections to going North. \n\n\"Who on earth, Tom, has filled your brain with those silly stories?\" asked my father calmly. \n\n\"Aunt Chloe, sir, she told me.\" \n\nMy father devoted that evening and several evenings to giving me a clear account of New England: its early struggles, its progress, and its present condition. I was no longer unwilling to go North; on the contrary, the proposed journey to a new world full of wonders kept me awake nights. Long before the moving day arrived I was eager to be off. My impatience was increased by the fact that my father had purchased for me a fine little Mustang pony, and shipped it to Rivermouth two weeks before the date set for our own journey. The pony completely resigned me to the situation. The pony's name was Gitana, which is the Spanish for \"gypsy\", so I always called her Gypsy. \n\nFinally the time came to leave the vine-covered mansion among the orange-trees, to say goodbye to little Sam(I am convince he was heartily glad to get rid of me), and to part with Aunt Chloe. I imagine them standing by the open garden gate; the tears are rolling down Aunt Chloe's cheeks; they and the old home fade away. I am never to see them again!",

His decision to \"actively explore\" a presidential bid accelerates the scramble for donors. It also gives the former Florida governor time to figure out how to overcome suspicion in the Republican base while positioning himself as the establishment candidate in a fragmented field. \n\nThe pre-holiday timing of the announcement was a big surprise to many beyond Bush's tight inner circle. Most of the political spotlight has been on Hillary Clinton this year, leaving GOP donors to sit back, hedge their bets and watch the field develop. \n\nBut Bush's decision to make a move now -- 13 months ahead of the Iowa caucus -- speaks to the complicated political decisions facing potential 2016 GOP candidates. They can maintain the coy stance of insisting they haven't made a decision on running, wait out the calendar and hopefully avoid a long, bruising primary like the one that left Mitt Romney damaged in 2012. Or they can start the work now to capture the staff and donors that can take on the Clinton machine. \n\nBush chose option B. \n\nAfter all, many GOP donors and operatives, who have serious doubts about much of the field but remain uneasy about the prospect of a bruising primary, have been waiting for a clear signal from either Bush or Romney, who is being pressured by many of his longtime supporters to make a third presidential run.

St. John's was incorporated as a city in 1888, yet is considered by some to be the oldest English-founded city in North America. It is located on the eastern tip of the Avalon Peninsula on the island of Newfoundland. With a population of 214,285 as of July 1, 2015, the St. John's Metropolitan Area is the second largest Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) in Atlantic Canada after Halifax and the 20th largest metropolitan area in Canada. It is one of the world's top ten oceanside destinations, according to National Geographic Magazine. Its name has been attributed to the feast day of John the Baptist, when John Cabot was believed to have sailed into the harbour in 1497, and also to a Basque fishing town with the same name. \n\nSt. John's is one of the oldest settlements in North America, with year-round settlement beginning sometime after 1630 and seasonal habitation long before that. It is not, however, the oldest surviving English settlement in North America or Canada, having been preceded by the Cuper's Cove colony at Cupids, founded in 1610, and the Bristol's Hope colony at Harbour Grace, founded in 1618. In fact, although English fishermen had begun setting up seasonal camps in Newfoundland in the 16th Century, they were expressly forbidden by the British government, at the urging of the West Country fishing industry, from establishing permanent settlements along the English controlled coast, hence the town of St. John's was not established as a permanent community until after the 1630s at the earliest. Other permanent English settlements in the Americas that predate St. John's include: St. George's, Bermuda (1612) and Jamestown, Virginia (1607).",

      "story": "Hong Kong, China (CNN) -- Hong Kong lawmakers resumed debate Wednesday on a bill that may result in the region's first statutory minimum wage. \n\nThe Minimum Wage Bill is a controversial piece of legislation that lawmakers hope will protect the most vulnerable workers in Hong Kong, one of the few places in the world without any sort of minimum wage law. \n\nThe debate is set to take two to three days. \n\nA recent government survey showed that around half a million workers in Hong Kong earn less than $4 an hour. These include low-skilled workers from the catering, retail, and cleaning industries. \n\nAccording to Man Hon Poon, a policy researcher at the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Union, the lack of legal protection for workers has led to serious exploitation. \n\n\"Workers in restaurants have to work for 12 hours or even 14 hours a day to earn a living,\" he said. \"They cannot even go to the cinema.\" \n\nLegislator Tommy Cheung, however, claims that the government should not interfere with the free market economy, which he says has served Hong Kong well in the past. A minimum wage could deter investors and lead to increased unemployment, said Cheung, who represents the catering industry. \n\n\"There is one fear within the industry, that they would have to close down,\" he said. \"When you see a closure, everyone loses out.\" \n\nThe government first proposed the current bill in 2008 following a failed attempt at a voluntary minimum wage. Labor unions, however, have been lobbying for a minimum wage since 1998, following the Asian financial crisis. ",

This organization does not give away free clothes or sell clothes for money. Instead, GOONJ asks people to work to help the community. In return, GOONJ supplies people with clothes. Suhklal said the experience made him happy. He felt proud of his work and his new clothes. \n\nIn 1998, Anshu Gupta and his wife wanted to help the people affected by a crisis , so they gathered all the clothes they had not worn. Looking at their gathered clothing, they wanted to start a new clothing organization. But they wanted their organization to be different from others. They wanted to collect clothing all year round -- not just in times of crisis. And more importantly, they wanted to serve people in a way that made them feel proud when receiving clothes. \n\nGOONJ makes sure the clothing is given to people who can use it. For example, people in areas with cooler temperatures receive warmer clothes. And people in villages that wear traditional clothing would receive traditional clothing. GOONJ also reuses clothes that people can't wear. For example, a shirt with holes can be made into a bag or used to make a blanket. \n\nGOONJ helps organize projects that improve the community. People receive clothes in return for their community work. Gupta believes this helps the receivers build self-respect, because they have earned the clothes. It also helps the receivers to be proud of what they have done to help their community. \n\nSince it began, GOONJ has expanded its work. GOONJ also collects more than just clothes. It collects home or school supplies. GOONJ also started a program that helps protect women's health.",

She still suffered from insomnia. Long nights passed in succession, during which she never closed her eyes. At other times she slept through long stupors, waking stunned and numbed, scarcely able to open her heavy eyes, to move her weary limbs. The pressure of the iron band on her head never relaxed. She was poorly nourished. Nor had she a cent of money. She often went a whole day without eating. Once, seventy-two hours elapsed without food passing her lips. She dug clams in the marsh, knocked the tiny oysters from the rocks, and gathered mussels. \n\nAnd yet, when Bud Strothers came to see how she was getting along, she convinced him that all was well. One evening after work, Tom came, and forced two dollars upon her. He was terribly worried. He would like to help more, but Sarah was expecting another baby. There had been slack times in his trade because of the strikes in the other trades. He did not know what the country was coming to. And it was all so simple. All they had to do was see things in his way and vote the way he voted. Then everybody would get a square deal. Christ was a Socialist, he told her. \n\n\"Christ died two thousand years ago,\" Saxon said. \n\n\"Well?\" Tom queried, not catching her implication. \n\n\"Think,\" she said, \"think of all the men and women who died in those two thousand years, and socialism has not come yet.

However, he went to work at an orphanage in Nepal. His first thought was to make people impressed. \"I thought that if I volunteered just once. I could retell the story over and over,\" Grennan said in a Huffington Post article. However, his three-month stay it the orphanage turned into in unusual experience. It was 2004 and Grennan had given up his job to begin a year-long around-the-world trip, His first three months were spent in Nepal. When he arrived in the village, he knew nothing about the children or the local culture. When he opened the gate of the Little Princes Children's Home, he was faced by the excited children. The young American ended up caring for 18 children. He later discovered that they were trafficked children. So he walked through the mountains with great difficulty to find the kids' families, \"I started walking with photos of the kids.\" he told the Reuters reporter. \"I would show up in villages and show photographs around. I went with 24 photos, and I found 24 families.\" At the same time, he put his heart into Nepalese culture. Grennan said, \"Volunteering is the single best way to see how the rest of the world lives.\" He also encouraged others to do what he had done. He believes that volunteering needs only making decisions to show up. Grennan's fight against child-trafficking has changed him. His book, Little Prince, came out last week.",

He is expected to get a one-year prison sentence. \n\nHis sentencing was delayed three weeks so he could get some dental work done, including removal of his diamond-studded braces. \n\nThe person familiar with the case would not confirm where Wayne would serve his sentence. \n\nThe plea agreement was a result of the rapper's 2007 arrest outside New York's Beacon Theater. \n\nAccording to police, Wayne had a .40-caliber pistol on his tour bus. \n\n\"It's not his gun, they know whose gun it is,\" Wayne's attorney, Stacey Richman, said after a hearing last month. \n\nIn an unrelated case, Wayne also faces felony drug possession and weapons charges in the state of Arizona. \n\nLil Wayne is a multiplatinum-selling and Grammy-winning rap artist. His hits include \"The Block is Hot\" and \"Lollipop,\" and his album \"Tha Carter III\" was the top-selling disc of 2008.

Carlos Kameni, though, could only push the ball out to Mulenga, who was left with a simple tap-in. \n\nZambia should have doubled their lead before half-time. Rainford Kalaba's fierce free-kick was pushed back into the danger area by Kameni but Christopher Katongo could not direct his shot away from the keeper. \n\nAnd that was made to look very costly in the 68th minute when a calamitous mistake from Mweene saw Cameroon draw level. \n\nGeremi sent in a hopeful cross from the right wing that the Zambia keeper inexplicably helped into his own net.

Just two years before her 100th birthday, Sensei Keiko Fukuda has become the first woman to achieve a tenth-degree black belt --- the highest rank in Judo . Fukuda is now one of only four living people who have earned the tenth-degree black belt. Throughout history, only 16 people have ever achieved this honor. Fukuda began practicing Judo in 1935 and is the only surviving student of its founder, Kano Jiguro. At her teacher's requirement, she learned English to help spread Judo internationally. During a time when getting married, building a family and becoming a housewife were the norms ,Fukuda broke from tradition, continuing Judo instead of getting married. \"All I did was Judo ... This was my marriage,\" Fukuda replied tearfully to the San Francisco Chronicle. \"This is when my destiny was set. I just imagined how long the road would be.\" She described the Jiguro's school as \"old-fashioned and sexist about belts and ranks\". In fact, an edict that prevented women from achieving any higher than a fifth-degree black belt kept Fukuda at that level for 30 years. She finally got the sixth degree in 1972 when a women's division was created. Fukuda thinks Judo and her life to be \"gentle, kind and beautiful, yet firm and strong, both mentally and physically\". Fukuda says this kind of beauty is not external . She explained. \"I believe this inner beauty is true beauty... All my life this has been my dream.\" Her dream was turned into reality, and the 98-year-old Sensei Keiko Fukuda continues to teach Judo three times a week at a women's Judo training center.",

The PIF animal shelter is crammed with almost 1,000 dogs of all sizes, ages and breeds (though the number that can claim any sort of pedigree is probably in single figures). \n\nMany are orphans of the conflict that has shaken this city for the past six months. Their owners have left or in a few cases been killed by the shelling. Some have been discovered tied up and emaciated; others carry the scars of shrapnel or hobble around on three legs. There are several in every cage, with a handful of straw to protect them from temperatures that plunge far below freezing at night. \n\nThe director of the sanctuary is Victoria Vasilieva, a tall middle-aged woman with jet black hair, whose compassion for the animals in her care is unstinting. She cradles a young dog called Jennifer, the only survivor when a shell hit her family's home near the airport. Jennifer was found traumatized in the ruins and it has taken weeks to gain her trust. \n\nVasilieva says that the dogs here used to be terrified by the sounds of war. Now, like the people of Donetsk, they hardly notice them. \n\nInside the office block, a puppy -- mostly black Labrador - is recovering from a broken leg and shrapnel wound. Vats of oatmeal are cooking in the yard. It's like feeding an army.

This organization does not give away free clothes or sell clothes for money. Instead, GOONJ asks people to work to help the community. In return, GOONJ supplies people with clothes. Suhklal said the experience made him happy. He felt proud of his work and his new clothes. \n\nIn 1998, Anshu Gupta and his wife wanted to help the people affected by a crisis , so they gathered all the clothes they had not worn. Looking at their gathered clothing, they wanted to start a new clothing organization. But they wanted their organization to be different from others. They wanted to collect clothing all year round -- not just in times of crisis. And more importantly, they wanted to serve people in a way that made them feel proud when receiving clothes. \n\nGOONJ makes sure the clothing is given to people who can use it. For example, people in areas with cooler temperatures receive warmer clothes. And people in villages that wear traditional clothing would receive traditional clothing. GOONJ also reuses clothes that people can't wear. For example, a shirt with holes can be made into a bag or used to make a blanket. \n\nGOONJ helps organize projects that improve the community. People receive clothes in return for their community work. Gupta believes this helps the receivers build self-respect, because they have earned the clothes. It also helps the receivers to be proud of what they have done to help their community. \n\nSince it began, GOONJ has expanded its work. GOONJ also collects more than just clothes. It collects home or school supplies. GOONJ also started a program that helps protect women's health.",

      "story": "Econometrics is the application of statistical methods to economic data and is described as the branch of economics that aims to give empirical content to economic relations. More precisely, it is \"the quantitative analysis of actual economic phenomena based on the concurrent development of theory and observation, related by appropriate methods of inference\". An introductory economics textbook describes econometrics as allowing economists \"to sift through mountains of data to extract simple relationships\". The first known use of the term \"econometrics\" (in cognate form) was by Polish economist Pawe\u0142 Ciompa in 1910. Jan Tinbergen is considered by many to be one of the founding fathers of econometrics. Ragnar Frisch is credited with coining the term in the sense in which it is used today. \n\nThe basic tool for econometrics is the multiple linear regression model. Econometric theory uses statistical theory and mathematical statistics to evaluate and develop econometric methods. Econometricians try to find estimators that have desirable statistical properties including unbiasedness, efficiency, and consistency. \"Applied econometrics\" uses theoretical econometrics and real-world data for assessing economic theories, developing econometric models, analyzing economic history, and forecasting. \n\nThe basic tool for econometrics is the multiple linear regression model. In modern econometrics, other statistical tools are frequently used, but linear regression is still the most frequently used starting point for an analysis. Estimating a linear regression on two variables can be visualized as fitting a line through data points representing paired values of the independent and dependent variables.",

Eisenhower established NASA in 1958 with a distinctly civilian (rather than military) orientation encouraging peaceful applications in space science. The National Aeronautics and Space Act was passed on July 29, 1958, disestablishing NASA's predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). The new agency became operational on October 1, 1958. \n\nSince that time, most US space exploration efforts have been led by NASA, including the Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab space station, and later the Space Shuttle. Currently, NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing the development of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, the Space Launch System and Commercial Crew vehicles. The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program (LSP) which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for unmanned NASA launches. \n\nNASA science is focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System, advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research Program, exploring bodies throughout the Solar System with advanced robotic spacecraft missions such as \"New Horizons\", and researching astrophysics topics, such as the Big Bang, through the Great Observatories and associated programs.

Those present at the graveside -- the royals closest to the late king -- were then to move on to a royal palace, where they were to pay their respects to the new monarch. \n\nThe ceremony of \"al Bayaah,\" or pledging of allegiance to the new king, followed the funeral. \n\nCondolences and remembrances poured in from all corners of the globe. \n\n\"To God we belong and indeed to him we shall return,\" said the homepage of the English-language Saudi newspaper Arab News. \n\nBahrain, Jordan and the Palestinian territories, among others, declared days of mourning.

In the season, the club began play in the AL as the Baltimore Orioles (no relation to the modern Baltimore Orioles). Frank Farrell and Bill Devery purchased the franchise (which had ceased operations) and moved it to New York City, renaming the club the New York Highlanders. The Highlanders were officially renamed the Yankees in . \n\nThe team is owned by Yankee Global Enterprises, an LLC controlled by the family of the late George Steinbrenner, who purchased the team in 1973. Brian Cashman is the team's general manager, and former catcher Joe Girardi is the team's manager. The team's home games were played at the original Yankee Stadium from 1923 to 1973 and from 1976 to 2008. In 2009, they moved into a new ballpark of the same name after the previous facility was closed and demolished.

In his book, A View from the Zoo, Gary Richmond describes how a new-born giraffe learns its first lesson. The mother giraffe lowers her head long enough to take a quick look. Then she puts herself directly over her child. She waits for about a minute, and then she does the most unreasonable thing. She throws her long leg and kicks her baby, so that it's sent sprawling . When it doesn't get up, what the mother has done is repeated again and again. The struggle to rise is important. As the baby giraffe grows tired, the mother kicks it again. Finally, it stands for the first time. Then the mother giraffe kicks it off again. Why? She wants it to remember how it can get up. In the wild, a baby giraffe must be able to get up as quickly as possible to stay with its group, where there's safety. Another writer named Irving Stone understood this. He spent a lifetime studying great people, writing stories about such men as Michelangelo, Vincent van Gogh, Sigmund Freud, and Charles Darwin. Stone was once asked if he had found something unusual about these great people. He said, \"I write about people who sometime in their life have a dream of something. They're beaten over the head, knocked down and for years they get nowhere. But every time they stand up again. And at the end of their lives they've realized some small parts of what they set out to do.\"",

      "story": "(CNN) -- CNN marked a milestone Monday. Just before noon, the @cnnbrk account topped 10 million followers on Twitter. That puts our Twitter account in the company of Lady Gaga, President Barack Obama and Cristiano Ronaldo. \n\nTo mark the occasion, it's worth reflecting how we got here. \n\nThe first tweet on @cnnbrk wasn't news, and it wasn't written by an employee of CNN. \n\n\"Testing\" is what James Cox tweeted in January 2007. \n\nCox said he started the account as a way to receive CNN's breaking news alerts on his phone. The account started to grow and gain attention. Journalist and fellow developer Brian Boyer posted this to his blog back in 2008: \"@cnnbrk ain't CNN but with >30K followers, he owns the brand.\" \n\nCox wrote a response to that post: \"I've been in contact with CNN -- they won't sue, i'm fairly sure, however i'm constantly dealing with the problem of confusion -- users still think that @cnnbrk is an official feed, therefore making me a defacto CNN employee, which is a problem.\" \n\nWe didn't sue, but we did work out a deal to get the handle. \n\nAs we celebrate reaching the 10-million-follower mark, Cox is the first person we should thank. \n\nThe second person to thank, naturally, is Ashton Kutcher. In 2009, he challenged CNN to a competition to see who could first reach 1 million followers. Kutcher won. At more than 13 million followers, @aplusk is still in the lead. And we're still coming after him. \n\nWe have a simple approach to @cnnbrk, and we believe that's one of the keys to its success. Breaking news, from an organization that built its brand on breaking news. Straight up. ",

      "story": "Horror is a genre of fiction which is intended to, or has the capacity to frighten, scare, disgust, or startle its readers or viewers by inducing feelings of horror and terror. Literary historian J. A. Cuddon has defined the horror story as \"a piece of fiction in prose of variable length... which shocks or even frightens the reader, or perhaps induces a feeling of repulsion or loathing\". It creates an eerie and frightening atmosphere. Horror is frequently supernatural, though it can be non-supernatural. Often the central menace of a work of horror fiction can be interpreted as a metaphor for the larger fears of a society. \n\nThe genre of horror has ancient origins with roots in folklore and religious traditions, focusing on death, the afterlife, evil, the demonic and the principle of the thing embodied in the person. These were manifested in stories of beings such as witchcraft, vampires, werewolves and ghosts. European horror fiction became established through works by the Ancient Greeks and Ancient Romans. In Greek mythology, Prometheus was a Titan who was the inspiration for the title of \"Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus\". Prometheus' earliest known appearance is in Hesiod's \"Theogony\". However, the story of Frankenstein was influenced far greater on the story of Hippolytus. Asclepius revived Hippolytus from death. Euripides wrote plays based on the story, \"Hippolytos Kalyptomenos\" and \"Hippolytus (play).\" Plutarch's \"The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans: Cimon\" describes the spirit of the murderer,Damon , who himself was murdered in a bathhouse in Chaeronea. Pliny the Younger describes Athenodorus Cananites who bought a haunted house in Athens. Athenodorus was cautious since the house was inexpensive. As Athenodorus writes a book a philosophy, he is visited by an aberration bound in chains. The figure disappears in the courtyard; the following day, the magistrates dig up the courtyard to find an unmarked grave.",

By contrast, the format was much more popular in Japan and in the more affluent regions of Southeast Asia, such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia, being the prevalent rental video medium in Hong Kong during the 1990s. Its superior video and audio quality did make it a somewhat popular choice among videophiles and film enthusiasts during its lifespan. \n\nLaserDisc was first available on the market, in Atlanta, Georgia, on December 15, 1978, two years after the introduction of the VHS VCR, and four years before the introduction of the CD (which is based on laser disc technology).

Mrs. Aylward evidently knew it, but said nothing; Molly preferred a petition to be her waiting maid; Jumbo grinned as if over-powered with inward mirth; the old ladies in the pew looked more sour and haughty than ever to discourage \"the artful minx,\" and the little girls asked all manner of absurd and puzzling questions. \n\nMy Lady was still at Bath, and Aurelia supposed that the marriage would take place on her return; and that the Major and Betty would perhaps accompany her. The former was quite in his usual health again, and had himself written to give her his blessing as a good dutiful maiden, and declare that he hoped to be with her for her wedding, and to give himself to his honoured friend. \n\nShe was the more amazed and startled when, one Sunday evening in spring, Mr. Hargrave came to her as she sat in her own parlour, saying, \"Madam, you will be amazed, but under the circumstances, the parson and myself being both here, Mr. Belamour trusts you will not object to the immediate performance of the ceremony.\" \n\nAurelia took some moments to realise what the ceremony was; and then she cried, \"Oh! but my father meant to have been here.\" \n\n\"Mr. Belamour thinks it better not to trouble Major Delavie to come up,\" said Mr. Hargrave; and as Aurelia stood in great distress and disappointment at this disregard of her wishes, he added, \"I think Miss Delavie cannot fail to understand Mr. Belamour's wishes to anticipate my Lady's arrival, so that he may be as little harassed as possible with display and publicity.

The commelinids are the only clade that the APG has informally named within the monocots. The remaining monocots are a paraphyletic unit. Also known as the commelinid monocots it forms one of three groupings within the monocots, and the final branch, the other two groups being the alismatid monocots and the lilioid monocots. \n\nMembers of the commelinid clade have cell walls containing UV-fluorescent ferulic acid. \n\nThe commelinids were first recognized as a formal group in 1967 by Armen Takhtajan, who named them the Commelinidae and assigned them to a subclass of the monocots. However, by the release of his 1980 system of classification, he had merged this subclass into a larger one no longer considered to be a clade. \n\nThe commelinids constitute a well-supported clade within the monocots, and this clade has been recognized in all four APG classification systems. \n\nThe commelinids of APG II (2003) and APG III (2009) contain essentially the same plants as the commelinoids of the earlier APG system (1998). In APG IV (2016) the family Dasypogonaceae is no longer directly placed under commelinids but instead a family of order Arecales.",

      "story": "(CNN) -- Robert Barchi believed he had much more important business to deal with at Rutgers, and in many ways, he's probably right. He is overseeing a massive merger between the university and the state's medical schools, one that will shape higher education in New Jersey for generations. \n\nBut now there was an issue involving a videotape of his basketball coach. This was early December, just after Rutgers had received a much-celebrated invitation to the Big Ten Conference. The tape contained clips of Mike Rice throwing basketballs at his players, shoving them and cursing at them, and using a homophobic slur. \n\nWhen it was given to ESPN months later, it dominated the airwaves for a week and sparked a scandal that rocked the Rutgers athletic department and, for many alums, disgraced the school. \n\nThe tape was toxic. The tape overshadowed everything Barchi was trying to accomplish on the New Brunswick, New Jersey, campus. But he never watched that tape until after it aired. \n\n\"It was a revelation,\" Barchi said a few weeks later, \"that the intensity of the response, both within the community, within the state and nationally on this very important and very serious issue could totally swamp out all of the other issues we're trying to deal with and color everything else we're doing.\" \n\nRevelation isn't the right word. Reality is. Barchi isn't the first university president -- and he won't be the last -- to learn how a scandal in college athletics can shape his administration or, for some, end it entirely. ",

He now has a million secrets. \"It's a drawing of a lift. And the secret says: 'I feel guilty when I take lifts for one floor, so I limp when I get out.'\" Frank said. \n\nTen years ago, Mr. Warren created an art project called PostSecret. People then began to send him postcards, other objects and emails telling their secrets. Every Sunday, he chooses 10 secrets and puts them on the website. \n\nMr. Warren says he created PostSecret so people could share their secrets in a safe place. \"I was struggling with secrets in my own life. And it was by creating this safe place where others could share their secrets with me, I think that space was something I needed just as much as they did.\" \n\nHe has published six books full of the secrets people have shared with him. One secret in each book is his. Eric Perry delivers mail for the U.S. Postal Service. He has brought thousands of secrets to Frank's home over the past three years. \"I have a couple of the books that Frank's given me and I've read them all and my family has read them all and it's wild!\" \n\nThe project itself was once one of Frank's secrets. His wife Jan didn't know exactly what he was doing until the first book was published. The publisher told him that the address was going to be on the book, and he refused. However, the address was there just because of the contract between them. Actually Warren wasn't very happy about that. \n\nSome people tell Frank of their secret desire to kill themselves. So he and the PostSecret community have raised more than $1 million to help prevent suicides .",

Purple superheroes, colorful games, and a bright blue ball all caught his eye, but Kyle kept looking. Finally he saw it, hiding on the bottom shelf. The most perfect toy- a shiny, white jeep. Kyle rushed to pick it up and show it to his dad. His dad thought the jeep was a great toy. And Kyle had enough money to buy it.

When Dad was finally ready to go, Kyle hurried to the car. Today was extra special because none of his sisters were going with them. His older sister Sandy was visiting her best friend. His younger sister Sarah was going to a movie with their mom. So today was a special day, only Kyle and Dad being guys together. \n\nOnce they reached the store, Kyle walked slowly down each aisle, looking at all the toys and trying to find the best one. Purple superheroes, colorful games, and a bright blue ball all caught his eye, but Kyle kept looking. Finally he saw it, hiding on the bottom shelf. The most perfect toy- a shiny, white jeep. Kyle rushed to pick it up and show it to his dad. His dad thought the jeep was a great toy. And Kyle had enough money to buy it.

Several cases were before the courts undecided, and until a decision was reached, the owners of the patent would do all in their power to prevent any one from interfering in the business which they proposed to make a monopoly. Therefore, when Bob went about his work, he did so with quite as much mystery as if he had been engaged in some decidedly unlawful act. \n\nThe ride from Sawyer, among the mountains, was quite as rough a one as that from Bradford, and Ralph found that he had about as much as he could attend to in keeping the guns, fishing-rods and himself in the carriage, without attempting to carry on any extended conversation with his friend. It was, therefore, almost in silence that the two rode along until George turned the horses abruptly from the main road into the woods, saying, as he did so: ",

      "story": "Horror is a genre of fiction which is intended to, or has the capacity to frighten, scare, disgust, or startle its readers or viewers by inducing feelings of horror and terror. Literary historian J. A. Cuddon has defined the horror story as \"a piece of fiction in prose of variable length... which shocks or even frightens the reader, or perhaps induces a feeling of repulsion or loathing\". It creates an eerie and frightening atmosphere. Horror is frequently supernatural, though it can be non-supernatural. Often the central menace of a work of horror fiction can be interpreted as a metaphor for the larger fears of a society. \n\nThe genre of horror has ancient origins with roots in folklore and religious traditions, focusing on death, the afterlife, evil, the demonic and the principle of the thing embodied in the person. These were manifested in stories of beings such as witchcraft, vampires, werewolves and ghosts. European horror fiction became established through works by the Ancient Greeks and Ancient Romans. In Greek mythology, Prometheus was a Titan who was the inspiration for the title of \"Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus\". Prometheus' earliest known appearance is in Hesiod's \"Theogony\". However, the story of Frankenstein was influenced far greater on the story of Hippolytus. Asclepius revived Hippolytus from death. Euripides wrote plays based on the story, \"Hippolytos Kalyptomenos\" and \"Hippolytus (play).\" Plutarch's \"The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans: Cimon\" describes the spirit of the murderer,Damon , who himself was murdered in a bathhouse in Chaeronea. Pliny the Younger describes Athenodorus Cananites who bought a haunted house in Athens. Athenodorus was cautious since the house was inexpensive. As Athenodorus writes a book a philosophy, he is visited by an aberration bound in chains. The figure disappears in the courtyard; the following day, the magistrates dig up the courtyard to find an unmarked grave.",

The commelinids are the only clade that the APG has informally named within the monocots. The remaining monocots are a paraphyletic unit. Also known as the commelinid monocots it forms one of three groupings within the monocots, and the final branch, the other two groups being the alismatid monocots and the lilioid monocots. \n\nMembers of the commelinid clade have cell walls containing UV-fluorescent ferulic acid. \n\nThe commelinids were first recognized as a formal group in 1967 by Armen Takhtajan, who named them the Commelinidae and assigned them to a subclass of the monocots. However, by the release of his 1980 system of classification, he had merged this subclass into a larger one no longer considered to be a clade. \n\nThe commelinids constitute a well-supported clade within the monocots, and this clade has been recognized in all four APG classification systems. \n\nThe commelinids of APG II (2003) and APG III (2009) contain essentially the same plants as the commelinoids of the earlier APG system (1998).

Moving from Miami to Houston to Atlanta, she started rapping in the Southern-style accent of her surroundings and her single \"Ignorant Art\" came out in 2011. From then on, she has never looked back. \n\nHowever, her style has caused lots of discussions. She might be one of the most polarizing artists. She raps with a southern American accent, even though she speaks with an Australian one. Many people comment that she overuses black culture in her music. \n\nHer supporters are against it. Female American rapper MC Lyte defended Azalea in an interview, saying she should not be judged because of where she's from. \"Hip hop is universal, no color1 lines.\" MC Lyte said.

      "story": "Infrared radiation is used in industrial, scientific, and medical applications. Night-vision devices using active near-infrared illumination allow people or animals to be observed without the observer being detected. Infrared astronomy uses sensor-equipped telescopes to penetrate dusty regions of space, such as molecular clouds; detect objects such as planets, and to view highly red-shifted objects from the early days of the universe. Infrared thermal-imaging cameras are used to detect heat loss in insulated systems, to observe changing blood flow in the skin, and to detect overheating of electrical apparatus. \n\nThe onset of infrared is defined (according to different standards) at various values typically between 700 nm and 800 nm, but the boundary between visible and infrared light is not precisely defined. The human eye is markedly less sensitive to light above 700 nm wavelength, so longer wavelengths make insignificant contributions to scenes illuminated by common light sources. However, particularly intense near-IR light (e.g., from IR lasers, IR LED sources, or from bright daylight with the visible light removed by colored gels) can be detected up to approximately 780 nm, and will be perceived as red light. Sources providing wavelengths as long as 1050 nm can be seen as a dull red glow in intense sources, causing some difficulty in near-IR illumination of scenes in the dark (usually this practical problem is solved by indirect illumination). Leaves are particularly bright in the near IR, and if all visible light leaks from around an IR-filter are blocked, and the eye is given a moment to adjust to the extremely dim image coming through a visually opaque IR-passing photographic filter, it is possible to see the Wood effect that consists of IR-glowing foliage.",

      "story": "MTV (originally an initialism of Music Television) is an American cable and satellite television channel owned by Viacom Media Networks (a division of Viacom) and headquartered in New York City. Launched on August 1, 1981, the channel originally aired music videos as guided by television personalities known as \"video jockeys\" (VJs). In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, particularly high school and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods. It has also become involved in promoting left-wing political issues and progressive social causes. The network received criticism towards this change of focus, both by certain segments of its audience and musicians. MTV's influence on its audience, including issues involving censorship and social activism, has also been a subject of debate for several years. \n\nIn recent years, MTV had struggled with the secular decline of music-related cable media. Its ratings had been said to be failing systematically, as younger viewers increasingly shift towards digital media, with yearly ratings drops as high as 29%; thus there was doubt of the lasting relevance of MTV towards young audiences.

The defeat followed Sharapova's capitulation against U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur 6-1, 7-5 on Wednesday. \n\n\"I really wasn't thinking about too much during the match,\" Li was quoted as saying on the WTA's official website after the match. \n\n\"I'm so happy I was able to beat Maria because she's a top player, and also today was my first match ever at the Championships, so I want to thank all the crowd here for supporting me.\" \n\nBut for Sharapova, who has struggled with an ankle injury but had the chance to become world number one with victory in Istanbul, there were some positives to be taken from two defeats in two days. \n\n\"I just have to be pleased that I recovered quickly enough to allow myself a chance of playing here,\" she told AFP. \n\nWorld number one Caroline Wozniacki crashed to defeat in her second red group match, losing 6-2 4-6 6-3 to Russia's Vera Zvonareva.

Mutter is also one of the world's youngest professors. \n\nBorn in Rheinfelden on June 29, 1963, Anne-Sophie grew up in Wehr, a small town just five kilometers from the Swiss border. Her father, Karl Wilhelm Mutter, and her mother, Gerlinde, considered music lessons part of a good education. Thus, their son, Andreas, began practicing the violin at eight, and his younger brother, Christoph, had piano lessons. It came as no surprise when Anne-Sophie said she wanted a violin for her fifth birthday. \n\nHer parents thought she was too young for the violin, and persuaded her to start on the piano. But Anne-Sophie has always had a mind of her own. \"I longed to play the violin,\" she says. \"It seemed to me a much more interesting instrument.\" After six months, her parents gave in. \n\nThe famous violin teacher Erna Honigberger, who lived nearby, became Anne-Sophie's tutor. After only nine months of lessons, she entered the six-year-old in a nationwide competition for young musicians. With Christoph accompanying her on the piano, Anne-Sophie won first prize. \n\nIn 1974, Erna, Erna Honigberger died. Anne - Sophie's new teacher was Aida Stucki. She taught Anne-Sophie to develop her own ideas on how a piece should be played, not just to imitate others. This is one of the violinist's strongest most distinctive characteristics today. \n\nThough the Mutters were short of money at time, they limited their daughter's performances to one or two a year. \"We are glad we went the family road,\" says her father. \"No outsider can ever have an effect on our daughter's career or push her into playing more concerts than she wants to.\" Later she was allowed to give six to eight concerts a year and make some recordings. Only when she turned 18 did she begin her professional career.",

He plainly saw the wish of Charles was to call into his camp such Frenchmen as, from their small number and high quality, might be considered rather as hostages than as auxiliaries; but, observant of Crevecoeur's advice, he assented as readily to whatever the Duke proposed, as if it had arisen from the free impulse of his own mind. \n\nThe King failed not, however, to indemnify himself for his complaisance by the indulgence of his vindictive temper against Balue, whose counsels had led him to repose such exuberant trust in the Duke of Burgundy. Tristan, who bore the summons for moving up his auxiliary forces, had the farther commission to carry the Cardinal to the Castle of Loches, and there shut him up in one of those iron cages which he himself is said to have invented.

While the region's economy shows high disparities with regard to income, all Central European countries are listed by the Human Development Index as very highly developed. \n\nElements of unity for Western and Central Europe were Roman Catholicism and Latin. Eastern Europe, which remained Eastern Orthodox Christian, was the area of Graeco-Byzantine cultural influence; after the schism (1054), The area developed cultural unity and resistance to the Western world (Catholic and Protestant) within the framework of Slavonic language and the Cyrillic alphabet. According to Hungarian historian Jen\u0151 Sz\u0171cs, foundations of Central European history at the first millennium were in close connection with Western European development. He explained that between the 11th and 15th centuries not only Christianization and its cultural consequences were implemented, but well-defined social features emerged in Central Europe based on Western characteristics. The keyword of Western social development after millennium was the spread of liberties and autonomies in Western Europe. These phenomena appeared in the middle of the 13th century in Central European countries. There were self-governments of towns, counties and parliaments.",

Her face was quite pale, and she held a letter in her hand. \"What does this mean, Kate?\" \n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Kate, her own color fading from her cheek. \n\n\"They are gone--with their horses. Left before day, and left this.\" \n\nShe handed Kate an open letter. The girl took it hurriedly, and read-- \n\n\"When you get this we shall be no more; perhaps not even as much. Ned found the trail yesterday, and we are taking the first advantage of it before day. We dared not trust ourselves to say 'Good-by!' last evening; we were too cowardly to face you this morning; we must go as we came, without warning, but not without regret. We leave a package and a letter for your husband. It is not only our poor return for your gentleness and hospitality, but, since it was accidentally the means of giving us the pleasure of your society, we beg you to keep it in safety until his return. We kiss your mother's hands. Ned wants to say something more, but time presses, and I only allow him to send his love to Minnie, and to tell her that he is trying to find the red snow. \n\n\"GEORGE LEE.\" \n\n\"But he is not fit to travel,\" said Mrs. Hale. \"And the trail--it may not be passable.\" \n\n\"It was passable the day before yesterday,\" said Kate drearily, \"for I discovered it, and went as far as the buck-eyes.\" ",

      "story": "South Dakota is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States. It is named after the Lakota and Dakota Sioux Native American tribes, who compose a large portion of the population and historically dominated the territory. South Dakota is the 17th most expansive, but the 5th least populous and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Once the southern part of the Dakota Territory, South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with North Dakota. Pierre is the state capital and Sioux Falls, with a population of about 171,000, is South Dakota's largest city. \n\nSouth Dakota is bordered by the states of North Dakota (on the north), Minnesota (to the east), Iowa (to the southeast), Nebraska (on the south), Wyoming (on the west), and Montana (to the northwest). The state is bisected by the Missouri River, dividing South Dakota into two geographically and socially distinct halves, known to residents as \"East River\" and \"West River\". \n\nEastern South Dakota is home to most of the state's population, and the area's fertile soil is used to grow a variety of crops. West of the Missouri, ranching is the predominant agricultural activity, and the economy is more dependent on tourism and defense spending. Most of the Native American reservations are in West River. The Black Hills, a group of low pine-covered mountains sacred to the Sioux, are in the southwest part of the state. Mount Rushmore, a major tourist destination, is there. South Dakota has a temperate continental climate, with four distinct seasons and precipitation ranging from moderate in the east to semi-arid in the west. The state's ecology features species typical of a North American grassland biome.",

      "story": "Rock and roll music developed in the United States in the early nineteen-fifties. It was based on the music called rhythm and blues that was performed by African American musicians. \n\nEarly rock and roll singers developed their own kinds of music. Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, the Beach Boys, and Bob Dylan were the most popular rock and roll musicians in the early 1960's. All were American. Then, in 1964, a new rock and roll group from England invaded America: the Beatles. \n\nSome people say the Beatles' music shook America like an earthquake. The Beatles changed rock and roll forever. Their early songs were influenced by American rock and roll musicians, including Chuck Berry. But the Beatles looked different and sounded different from any musical group before them. \n\nThe Beatles released their first album in the United States in 1964, when all of the top five records in America were by the Beatles. In 1967, they released an album called \"Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\" It was one of the first \"concept\" albums. That is, all the songs were linked by a common story or idea. \n\nThe popularity of the Beatles led the way for more rock and roll bands from England to become popular in America. The Rolling Stones was the most important of these bands. The Rolling Stones is one of the few groups from the 1960's that is still performing and recording today. In 1965, the group recorded one of its most famous songs, \"Satisfaction\". \n\nThe musical instrument most linked to rock and roll is the guitar. Experts say Jimi Hendrix was one of the most influential guitar players in rock and roll during the late 1960's. His \"Purple Haze\" was liked by many people. \n\nBy the 1970's, rock and roll music became known as rock music. It expanded into many new forms. For example, there was country rock, hard rock, acid rock, and heavy metal rock. Punk rock, jazz rock, and glitter rock. \n\nIn the middle 1970's, experts say rock music regained some of the energy of early rock and roll. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band became popular with their album \"Born to Run\". Springsteen's music was like the lively rock and roll music of the early nineteen-sixties. Many of his songs were about social issues. He sang about the effects of unemployment and the war in Vietnam.",

His trial is expected to begin on Thursday, August 22, the latest chapter in a gripping tale of murder, betrayal and political factionalism. \n\nThe authorities claim he abused his official state position to seek financial benefits, resulting in \"huge losses to the nation and the people.\" \n\n\"The circumstances are extremely serious,\" a statement in the state-run Xinhua news agency declared a few days later. \n\nBut a source close to the Bo family for decades says the claims are \"ridiculous.\" \n\n\"The charges go way back when Bo was in Dalian. That's more than 20 years ago. So they cannot find anything more recent?\" \n\nREAD MORE: Bo Xilai indicted for corruption \n\nUntil March 2012, the charismatic, populist leader was a member of the policy-making politburo of the Communist Party and party chief of Chongqing, a megacity in southwestern China. \n\nBo, 64, is currently in detention, awaiting a trial that could cap the biggest political scandal to hit China in decades. He has not been seen in public since news of the scandal emerged, and he was stripped of his role as Chongqing party chief and later his prestigious politburo post. \n\nTIMELINE: Bo's fall from grace \n\nBo stands accused of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power. According to the indictment documents, as a civil servant he took advantage of his position to seek profit from others and accepted an extremely large amount of money and properties, Xinhua reported. The documents don't quantify the amount of bribes allegedly accepted, but published reports say it could be as much as 20 million yuan ($3.3 million). ",

The province borders the Chinese provinces Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, and the Tibet Autonomous Region, and the countries Vietnam, Laos, and Burma. \n\nYunnan is situated in a mountainous area, with high elevations in the northwest and low elevations in the southeast. Most of the population lives in the eastern part of the province. In the west, the altitude can vary from the mountain peaks to river valleys as much as . Yunnan is rich in natural resources and has the largest diversity of plant life in China. Of the approximately 30,000 species of higher plants in China, Yunnan has perhaps 17,000 or more. Yunnan's reserves of aluminium, lead, zinc and tin are the largest in China, and there are also major reserves of copper and nickel. \n\nThe Han Empire first recorded diplomatic relations with the province at the end of the 2nd century BC. It became the seat of a Sino-Tibetan-speaking kingdom of Nanzhao in the 8th century AD. Nanzhao was multi-ethnic, but the elite most-likely spoke a northern dialect of Yi. The Mongols conquered the region in the 13th century, with local control exercised by warlords until the 1930s. From the Yuan dynasty onward, the area was part of a central-government sponsored population movement towards the Southwestern frontier, with 2 major waves of migrants arriving from Han-majority areas in northern and southeast China. As with other parts of China's southwest, Japanese occupation in the north during World War II forced another migration of majority Han people into the region. These two waves of migration contributed to Yunnan being one of the most ethnically diverse provinces of China, with ethnic minorities accounting for about 34 percent of its total population. Major ethnic groups include Yi, Bai, Hani, Zhuang, Dai and Miao.",

It had a square hole as tall as Johnny and it hummed like a fridge. \n\nJohnny took a deep breath and stepped inside. Just a peek, he thought. \n\nThere were three buttons inside. One said \"past,\" and one said \"present.\" Another said \"space.\" \n\nJohnny looked at the buttons. He looked at the buttons some more. He waited and without thinking, his arm jumped out in front of him. He pushed the button that said \"past.\" \n\nThere was a bright light! And bam! \n\nJohnny stepped out of the machine. It was raining, and there were many strange looking trees. The air was warm. The dirt below was muddy. \n\nHe took a deep breath. \"So this is the past,\" Johnny said. \n\nJust then he heard a bump. And another one. The ground shook. The bumps got louder and the ground shook harder. A tree fell. \n\nJohnny heard a roar. \n\nTwo more trees fell. \n\nSuddenly, Johnny saw it: A Tyrannosaurus Rex! \n\nJohnny was so scared he couldn't breathe. \n\nThe T. Rex looked up, and left, and right. He sniffed the air and leaned down. He didn't seem to see Johnny. \n\nThen Johnny sneezed. And the T. Rex started walking towards him. Faster and faster. Bump.

For over two hours they had been moving up the Hudson River, slowly, scanning one shore and the other with care. They had noted many boats, but nothing that looked like the schooner for which they were so eagerly searching. \n\n\"They had a pretty good start of you,\" said John Slater, the owner of the motor-boat. \"Maybe they are up to Nyack or Haverstraw by this time.\" \n\n\"Well, all we can do is to keep on and watch out,\" said Tom, with a sigh. His disposition, for fun seemed to have entirely left him. \n\nAnother half hour went by, and they came in sight of a number of lumber barges, all heavily loaded. The barges were being towed by a big tug. \n\n\"I know the captain of that tug,\" said John Slater. \"We might ask him about the schooner.\" \n\n\"A good idea,\" answered Dick. \n\nThey were soon close to the steam tug and the motor-boat owner waved his hand to the captain of the larger craft, who waved in return. \n\n\"I want to find a schooner named the Ellen Rodney!\" shouted John Slater. \"Did you pass her, Captain Voss?\" \n\n\"I did,\" was the answer. \"She was opposite Nyack, heading in to shore.\" \n\n\"Opposite Nyack!\" exclaimed Dick, \"How far is that from here?\" \n\n\"Not more than two miles,\" answered John Slater, as he turned his motor-boat up the river again.

It is said to occupy continuous territory that are otherwise conventionally Eastern Europe and Western Europe. The concept of Central Europe is based on a common historical, social and cultural identity. Central Europe is going through a phase of \"strategic awakening\", with initiatives such as the CEI, Centrope and the Visegr\u00e1d Four. While the region's economy shows high disparities with regard to income, all Central European countries are listed by the Human Development Index as very highly developed. \n\nElements of unity for Western and Central Europe were Roman Catholicism and Latin. Eastern Europe, which remained Eastern Orthodox Christian, was the area of Graeco-Byzantine cultural influence; after the schism (1054), The area developed cultural unity and resistance to the Western world (Catholic and Protestant) within the framework of Slavonic language and the Cyrillic alphabet. According to Hungarian historian Jen\u0151 Sz\u0171cs, foundations of Central European history at the first millennium were in close connection with Western European development. He explained that between the 11th and 15th centuries not only Christianization and its cultural consequences were implemented, but well-defined social features emerged in Central Europe based on Western characteristics. The keyword of Western social development after millennium was the spread of liberties and autonomies in Western Europe. These phenomena appeared in the middle of the 13th century in Central European countries. There were self-governments of towns, counties and parliaments.",

That incident is believed to be the first attack on a foreign ambassador in South Korea. \n\n-- Kim allegedly harbored sympathies for North Korea, according to Korean media reports. Yonhap reported that Kim had visited North Korea six times between 2006 and 2007, had attempted to erect a memorial for former North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il in Seoul, and once set himself on fire in front of the presidential office. \n\n-- He was frequently seen at protests, wearing a beret and blaming U.S. policies for straining relations between North and South Korea. \n\nKim was a member of the Korea Council For Reconciliation and Cooperation, which hosted Lippert at the Thursday event where the attack occurred. The group advocates reunification of the Koreas as well as humanitarian aid to North Korea. Kim was one of its 181 members, but wasn't on the list of those invited for the event, according to police. But he was allowed in because an event staff recognized him from the organization. ",

The bus driver said \"good to see you Bob\". Bob said \"you too Mr. Smith\". Bob was so excited to see his friends that he could barely breathe. As he walked down the school bus, Bob's friends Jill, Jim, Jeff and Chris all waved to him. Instead of sitting next to his best friend Chris, Bob turned left and sat next to Jill. Jeff and Jim started laughing at him and teased \"Bob and Jill sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G\". Bob's face turned red from embarrassment. Chris felt bad for Bob and reached into his pockets to help his friend. When he reached in, he felt a pencil, a rock and a folded up piece of paper. Chris's eyes twinkled. He had a plan. Without Jim and Jeff seeing, Chris quickly made a paper airplane with the piece of paper he found in his pocket. He threw the paper airplane at Jim. The plane hit Jim in the face. Both Jim and Jeff stopped laughing. Bob looked over to Chris and smiled.",

Thomas was flown to a hospital, where he later died. \n\n\"It's just too early to speculate\" on a motive for the shooting, said Kevin Winker, assistant director of the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation. \n\nAuthorities said Becker was a former student at Aplington-Parkersburg, which is about 100 miles northeast of Des Moines, Iowa, and a former football player. \n\nThe agency, however, noted that Becker had \"recent contact\" with police in Cedar Falls, Iowa, about 25 miles to the east of Parkersburg. On June 20, Becker led police on a high-speed chase after he allegedly broke into a man's house, according to a division statement. He was taken into custody, but early the next morning authorities determined he needed medical attention and he was taken to a hospital. Police asked to be notified when he was released, the statement said. \n\nBut on Tuesday, Becker was released and spent the night at his parents' Parkersburg home before heading to the high school Wednesday morning, the division said. \"Law enforcement was unaware that Becker had been released.\" ",

As his power grew, his enemies increased in number, and bitter disputes with the high nobility became frequent. In 1758 Joseph I was wounded in an attempted assassination. The T\u00e1vora family and the Duke of Aveiro were implicated and executed after a quick trial. The Jesuits were expelled from the country and their assets confiscated by the crown. Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo prosecuted every person involved, even women and children. This was the final stroke that broke the power of the aristocracy. Joseph I made his loyal minister Count of Oeiras in 1759. \n\nFollowing the T\u00e1vora affair, the new Count of Oeiras knew no opposition. Made \"Marquis of Pombal\" in 1770, he effectively ruled Portugal until Joseph I's death in 1779. However, historians also argue that Pombal\u2019s \"enlightenment,\" while far-reaching, was primarily a mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty and especially an apparatus for crushing opposition, suppressing criticism, and furthering colonial economic exploitation as well as intensifying book censorship and consolidating personal control and profit.",

      "story": "The American Revolution was a colonial revolt that took place between 1765 and 1783. The American Patriots in the Thirteen Colonies won independence from Great Britain, becoming the United States of America. They defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War in alliance with France and others. \n\nMembers of American colonial society argued the position of \"no taxation without representation\", starting with the Stamp Act Congress in 1765. They rejected the authority of the British Parliament to tax them because they lacked representation in Parliament. Protests steadily escalated to the burning of the \"Gaspee\" in Rhode Island in 1772, followed by the Boston Tea Party in 1773, during which patriots destroyed a consignment of taxed tea. The British responded by closing Boston Harbor, then followed with a series of legislative acts which effectively rescinded Massachusetts Bay Colony's rights of self-government and caused the other colonies to rally behind Massachusetts. In late 1774, the Patriots set up their own alternative government to better coordinate their resistance efforts against Great Britain; other colonists preferred to remain aligned to the British Crown and were known as Loyalists or Tories. \n\nTensions erupted into battle between Patriot militia and British regulars when the British attempted to capture and destroy Colonial military supplies at Lexington and Concord in April 1775. The conflict then developed into a global war, during which the Patriots (and later their French, Spanish, and Dutch allies) fought the British and Loyalists in what became known as the American Revolutionary War (1775\u201383). Each of the thirteen colonies formed a Provincial Congress that assumed power from the old colonial governments and suppressed Loyalism, and from there they built a Continental Army under the leadership of General George Washington. The Continental Congress determined King George's rule to be tyrannical and infringing the colonists' rights as Englishmen, and they declared the colonies free and independent states on July 2, 1776. The Patriot leadership professed the political philosophies of liberalism and republicanism to reject monarchy and aristocracy, and they proclaimed that all men are created equal.",

It is the color of chalk and many bleached materials such as paper when they do not have added colorant. \n\nAccording to surveys in Europe and the United States, white is the color most often associated with perfection, the good, honesty, cleanliness, the beginning, the new, neutrality, and exactitude. White is an important color for almost all world religions. The Pope, the head of the Roman Catholic Church, has worn white since 1566, as a symbol of purity and sacrifice. In Islam, and in the Shinto religion of Japan, it is worn by pilgrims; and by the Brahmins in India. In Western cultures and in Japan, white is the most common color for wedding dresses, symbolizing purity and virginity. In many Asian cultures, white is also the color of mourning. \n\nIn ancient Egypt and ancient Rome, priestesses wore white as a symbol of purity, and Romans wore a white toga as a symbol of citizenship. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance a white unicorn symbolized chastity, and a white lamb sacrifice and purity. It was the royal color of the Kings of France, and of the monarchist movement that opposed the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War (1917\u20131922). Greek and Roman temples were faced with white marble, and beginning in the 18th century, with the advent of neoclassical architecture, white became the most common color of new churches, capitols and other government buildings, especially in the United States. It was also widely used in 20th century modern architecture as a symbol of modernity and simplicity.",

He studies long hours, gets very little sleep and as a result, he drinks a lot of coffee---anywhere from five to six cups a day. Recently, Adam felt that drinking thus much coffee was making it hard for him to sleep at all. He also began having problems with his concentration , and complained of stomachaches. Adam's doctor made this suggestions: stop drinking coffee altogether. When Adam got up on October 3, he began his day without his morning coffee. By 11:00 a.m., Adam was in a terrible mood . He was tired and had a headache. At 11:30, he had a meeting with his student advisor. In the meeting, he found it almost impossible to continue. What was going on? Caffeine, a chemical found in coffee, was most likely the reason for how Adam felt. Caffeine is a stimulant that boosts energy levels and improves concentration- but only for a short time. Lowering caffeine consumption often causes a drop in blood pressure and the result is a \"coffee headache\", People who stop drinking coffee often say they feel tired and moody, and find it hard to focus. The good news is that these feeling usually pass after four and five days. During this time, doctors suggested taking some aspirin for the headache. So, if Adam can wait, in less than a week, he may be feeling much better.",

      "story": "(CNN) -- A man suspected of fatally shooting an Iowa football coach Wednesday was released from a hospital the day before, without the knowledge of police, who had asked to be notified, authorities said. \n\nEd Thomas had been with the school district for more than 30 years and was well-known in the region. \n\nMark Becker, 24, faces first-degree murder charges in the death of Ed Thomas, 58, a longtime football coach at Aplington-Parkersburg High School. \n\nInvestigators believe Becker walked into the school's weight room, where Thomas was overseeing athletes' weight lifting, about 7:45 a.m. Wednesday and shot him multiple times as about 20 horrified students looked on. Thomas was flown to a hospital, where he later died. \n\n\"It's just too early to speculate\" on a motive for the shooting, said Kevin Winker, assistant director of the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation. \n\nAuthorities said Becker was a former student at Aplington-Parkersburg, which is about 100 miles northeast of Des Moines, Iowa, and a former football player. \n\nThe agency, however, noted that Becker had \"recent contact\" with police in Cedar Falls, Iowa, about 25 miles to the east of Parkersburg. On June 20, Becker led police on a high-speed chase after he allegedly broke into a man's house, according to a division statement. He was taken into custody, but early the next morning authorities determined he needed medical attention and he was taken to a hospital. Police asked to be notified when he was released, the statement said. \n\nBut on Tuesday, Becker was released and spent the night at his parents' Parkersburg home before heading to the high school Wednesday morning, the division said. \"Law enforcement was unaware that Becker had been released.\" ",

      "story": "A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \"planet\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \"planets\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. \n\nThe planets were thought by Ptolemy to orbit Earth in deferent and epicycle motions. Although the idea that the planets orbited the Sun had been suggested many times, it was not until the 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first telescopic astronomical observations, performed by Galileo Galilei. At about the same time, by careful analysis of pre-telescopic observation data collected by Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler found the planets' orbits were not circular but elliptical. As observational tools improved, astronomers saw that, like Earth, the planets rotated around tilted axes, and some shared such features as ice caps and seasons. Since the dawn of the Space Age, close observation by space probes has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics, and even hydrology.",

August 11th, Neipperg, provoked by the grievous news just come from Breslau, pushes suddenly forward on Schweidnitz, by way of consolation; Schweidnitz, not so strong as it might be made, where the Prussians have a principal Magazine: \"One might at least seize that?\" thinks Neipperg, in his vexed humor. But here too Friedrich was beforehand with him; broke out, rapidly enough, to Reichenbach, westward, which bars the Neipperg road to Schweidnitz: upon which,--or even before which (on rumor of it coming, which was not YET true),--Neipperg, half done with his first day's march, called halt; prudently turned back, and hastened, Baumgarten way, to his strong Camp at Frankenstein again. His hope in the Schweidnitz direction had lasted only a few hours; a hope springing on the mere spur of pique, soon recognizable by him as futile; and now anxieties for self-preservation had succeeded it on Neipperg's part. For now Friedrich actually advances on him, in a menacing manner, hardly hoping Neipperg will fight; but determined to have done with the Neisse business, in spite of strong camps and cunctations, if it be possible. [Orlich, i. 137, 138.] \n\nIt was August 16th, when Friedrich stirred out of Strehlen; August 21st, when he encamped at Reichenbach. Till September 7th, he kept manoeuvring upon Neipperg, who counter-manoeuvred with vigilance, good judgment, and would not come to action: September 7th, Friedrich, weary of these hagglings, dashed off for Neisse itself, hoped to be across Neisse River, and be between Neisse Town and Neipperg, before Neipperg could get up. There would then be no method of preventing the Siege of Neisse, except by a Battle: so Friedrich had hoped; but Neipperg again proved vigilant. ",

The farmers who lived there were the Nixon family. They grew corn. Sometimes when the weather was right, they would plant wheat, too. The fields were so large that the class could not see where they ended. Mr. Nixon gave all of the children a long ride in the fields on his tractor. The Nixon family also had a lot of farm animals. In the red barn next to their home, they kept a few cows and horses. Everyone fed hay to some of the cows. The farmers got milk from their cows. Some of the class got small bottles of fresh milk to take home with them. All the kids got to ride on the big brown horses the Nixons had. They went up into the nearby hills, where they could look down on the farm below. Around the farmyard there were many goats and chickens, who wandered around as they wished. The Nixon children liked to play with their goats, feed them peanut shells and pet them, like the first grade kids did with their dogs and cats. The smallest tried to bump the children with their hard heads and tiny horns! When it was almost dark, the school kids got back on the bus to go home.

      "story": "(CNN) -- Nasser Al-Attiyah has called time on the defense of his Dakar Rally title, pulling out of the 2012 race after problems with his car. \n\nThe Qatari quit the annual race across South America after his temperamental Hummer broke down on the ninth stage between Antofagasta and Iquique in Chile. \n\nAl-Attiyah has endured a litany of problems with his vehicle since the start of the race on New Year's Day and threw in the towel after 174km of the ninth stage having made three unscheduled stops. \n\nAmerican Bobby Gordon didn't have any such problems as he claimed his first stage win in the 2012 race to further close the gap on overall leader Stephane Peterhansel. \n\nGordon cuts Peterhansel's lead in stage eight \n\nThe Frenchman -- a six-time motorbike and three-time car champion in the Dakar -- finished a minute and 38 seconds behind Gordon, with Spain's Nani Roma third. \n\nWith four days remaining in the race Gordon, a NASCAR veteran, trails Peterhansel by nearly six minutes in the overall standings. \n\nHe said: \"We had a couple of big scary moments. For us, we've got to make time. We're in a different position to him (Peterhansel). He has to conserve his time and I've got to make it. \n\n\"We've got four days left, four real days of racing left and the Hummer's strong. I can't believe he could catch us there, because we were going crazy. So he's a madman; if he beats us, he's a madman. Madder than me!\" \n\nIn the motorbike classification, Cyril Despres won stage nine to return to the top of the overall standings in his seesaw battle with Spain's Mark Como. ",

      "story": "The first known European explorer to reach Bermuda was Spanish sea captain Juan de Berm\u00fadez in 1503, after whom the islands are named. He claimed the apparently uninhabited islands for the Spanish Empire. Paying two visits to the archipelago, Berm\u00fadez never landed on the islands, but did create a recognisable map of the archipelago. Shipwrecked Portuguese mariners are now thought to have been responsible for the 1543 inscription in Portuguese Rock (previously called Spanish Rock). Subsequent Spanish or other European parties are believed to have released pigs there, which had become feral and abundant on the island by the time European settlement began. In 1609, the English Virginia Company, which had established Jamestown in Virginia (a term originally applied to all of the North American continent) two years earlier, permanently settled Bermuda in the aftermath of a hurricane, when the crew and passengers of the Sea Venture steered the ship onto the surrounding reef to prevent its sinking, then landed ashore.",

The army was initially led by men who had served in the British Army or colonial militias and who brought much of British military heritage with them. As the Revolutionary War progressed, French aid, resources, and military thinking influenced the new army. A number of European soldiers came on their own to help, such as Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, who taught the army Prussian tactics and organizational skills. \n\nThe Vietnam War is often regarded as a low point for the U.S. Army due to the use of drafted personnel, the unpopularity of the war with the American public, and frustrating restrictions placed on the military by American political leaders. While American forces had been stationed in the Republic of Vietnam since 1959, in intelligence & advising/training roles, they did not deploy in large numbers until 1965, after the Gulf of Tonkin Incident.

      "story": "A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \"planet\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \"planets\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. \n\nThe planets were thought by Ptolemy to orbit Earth in deferent and epicycle motions. Although the idea that the planets orbited the Sun had been suggested many times, it was not until the 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first telescopic astronomical observations, performed by Galileo Galilei. At about the same time, by careful analysis of pre-telescopic observation data collected by Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler found the planets' orbits were not circular but elliptical. As observational tools improved, astronomers saw that, like Earth, the planets rotated around tilted axes, and some shared such features as ice caps and seasons. Since the dawn of the Space Age, close observation by space probes has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics, and even hydrology.",

      "story": "Chapter IV. -- FRIEDRICH TAKES THE FIELD AGAIN, INTENT ON HAVING NEISSE. \n\nThis Breslau Adventure, which had yielded Friedrich so important an acquisition, was furthermore the cause of ending these Strehlen inactivities, and of recommencing field operations. August 11th, Neipperg, provoked by the grievous news just come from Breslau, pushes suddenly forward on Schweidnitz, by way of consolation; Schweidnitz, not so strong as it might be made, where the Prussians have a principal Magazine: \"One might at least seize that?\" thinks Neipperg, in his vexed humor. But here too Friedrich was beforehand with him; broke out, rapidly enough, to Reichenbach, westward, which bars the Neipperg road to Schweidnitz: upon which,--or even before which (on rumor of it coming, which was not YET true),--Neipperg, half done with his first day's march, called halt; prudently turned back, and hastened, Baumgarten way, to his strong Camp at Frankenstein again. His hope in the Schweidnitz direction had lasted only a few hours; a hope springing on the mere spur of pique, soon recognizable by him as futile; and now anxieties for self-preservation had succeeded it on Neipperg's part. For now Friedrich actually advances on him, in a menacing manner, hardly hoping Neipperg will fight; but determined to have done with the Neisse business, in spite of strong camps and cunctations, if it be possible. [Orlich, i. 137, 138.] \n\nIt was August 16th, when Friedrich stirred out of Strehlen; August 21st, when he encamped at Reichenbach. Till September 7th, he kept manoeuvring upon Neipperg, who counter-manoeuvred with vigilance, good judgment, and would not come to action: September 7th, Friedrich, weary of these hagglings, dashed off for Neisse itself, hoped to be across Neisse River, and be between Neisse Town and Neipperg, before Neipperg could get up. There would then be no method of preventing the Siege of Neisse, except by a Battle: so Friedrich had hoped; but Neipperg again proved vigilant. ",

Lisa has several pets, but her favorite one is her dog, Ben. Tony used a potato to make stars. He then put the potato into different colors of paint and made a nice pattern. Johnny used feathers to make his picture. When they had finished, the class chose which picture was the best. Johnny got second place and was very excited. Then it was time for lunch and the class had a party. They had hamburgers with ketchup and had cake for dessert. It was a very fun day for the whole class. They all went home tired and happy.

      "story": "An old problem is getting new attention in the United States--bullying. Recent cases included the tragic case of a 15-year-old girl whose family moved from Ireland. She hanged herself in Massachusetts following months of bullying. Her parents criticized her school for failing to protect her. Officials have brought criminal charges against several teenagers. \n\nJudy Kuczynski is president of an anti-bullying group called Bully Police USA. Her daughter Tina was also the victim of severe bullying starting in middle school in the state of Minnesota. She said,\"Our daughter was a very outgoing child. She was involved in all kinds of things and had lots of friends. And over a period of time her grades fell completely. She started having health issues. She couldn't sleep. She wasn't eating. She had terrible stomach pains and didn't want to go to school.\" \n\nBullying is defined as negative behavior repeated over time against the same person. It can involve physical violence, or it can be verbal--for example, insults or threats. Spreading lies about someone or excluding a person from a group is known as social or relational bullying. \n\nAnd now there is cyber-bullying, which uses the Internet, e-mail or text messages. It has easy appeal for the bully because it does not involve face-to-face contact and it can be done at any time. \n\nThe first serious research studies into bullying were done in Norway in the late 1970s. The latest government study in the United States was released last year. It found that about one-third of students age twelve to eighteen were bullied at school. \n\nSusan Swearer is a psychologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and co-director of the Bullying Research Network. She says schools should treat bullying as a mental health problem to get bullies and victims the help they need. She says bullying is connected to depression, anxiety and anti-social behavior and bullies are often victims themselves.",

There were voices on the porch, where Howard was saying good-by to Mrs. Chandos and Trixton Brent. She joined them. \n\n\"Oh, my dear!\" cried Mrs. Chandos, interrupting Honora's apologies, \"I'm sure I shan't sleep a wink--she gave me such a fright. You might have sent Trixy ahead to prepare us. When I first caught sight of her, I thought it was my own dear mother who had come all the way from Cleveland, and the cigarette burned my fingers.

Good night, dear.\" \n\nAnd she got into her carriage. \n\n\"Give my love to Mrs. Holt,\" said Brent, as he took Honora's hand, \"and tell her I feel hurt that she neglected to say good night to me.

Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a totalitarian state in which the Nazi Party controlled nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \"Deutsches Reich\" from 1933 to 1943 and \"Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich\" (\"Greater German Reich\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich () and the National Socialist Period (, abbreviated as \"NS-Zeit\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. \n\nHitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany by the President of the Weimar Republic Paul von Hindenburg on 30 January 1933. The Nazi Party then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power. Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934, and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the powers and offices of the Chancellery and Presidency. A national referendum held 19 August 1934 confirmed Hitler as sole F\u00fchrer (leader) of Germany. All power was centralised in Hitler's person, and his word became above all laws. The government was not a coordinated, co-operating body, but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler's favour. In the midst of the Great Depression, the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a mixed economy. Extensive public works were undertaken, including the construction of \"Autobahnen\" (motorways). The return to economic stability boosted the regime's popularity.",

Joseph Schumpeter saw the creation of new bourgeoisie as the driving force behind the capitalist engine, particularly entrepreneurs who took risks to bring innovation to industries and the economy through the process of creative destruction.

He went to the kitchen, where he poured some milk into his favorite green bowl and added some cereal. After he finished eating, he went back up to his bedroom to choose his clothes for the day. He put on a red T-shirt and blue jeans, and some funny blue-and-yellow socks. He looked in the mirror and smiled. It was going to be a good day. Marvin thought he would go for a walk. He opened his door and went outside. The sun was shining and he could hear the bluebirds in the trees. Marvin started to whistle a happy song as he made his way down the street. He counted the cars that passed by. Along the way he saw his friend Lisa, and waved to her. She waved back, and came over. \"Hi Marvin,\" she said. \"Do you want to go to the lake today?\" Marvin smiled. \"Yeah!\" he said, \"let me go home and get my things.\" So Marvin turned right around and went back home.",

      "story": "The first known European explorer to reach Bermuda was Spanish sea captain Juan de Berm\u00fadez in 1503, after whom the islands are named. He claimed the apparently uninhabited islands for the Spanish Empire. Paying two visits to the archipelago, Berm\u00fadez never landed on the islands, but did create a recognisable map of the archipelago. Shipwrecked Portuguese mariners are now thought to have been responsible for the 1543 inscription in Portuguese Rock (previously called Spanish Rock). Subsequent Spanish or other European parties are believed to have released pigs there, which had become feral and abundant on the island by the time European settlement began. In 1609, the English Virginia Company, which had established Jamestown in Virginia (a term originally applied to all of the North American continent) two years earlier, permanently settled Bermuda in the aftermath of a hurricane, when the crew and passengers of the Sea Venture steered the ship onto the surrounding reef to prevent its sinking, then landed ashore.",

The royal court didn't release an exact cause of death. He was 90. \n\nTo ensure a smooth transition, the kingdom quickly appointed his 79-year-old half-brother, Salman bin Abdulaziz, to the throne. His half-brother Prince Muqrin, a decade younger, is the new crown prince. \n\nWho is Salman bin Abdulaziz? \n\nAfter Friday afternoon prayers at Riyadh's Imam Turki Bin Abdullah Grand Mosque, the body of Abdullah, wrapped in a pale shroud, was carried from the mosque toward a cemetery, followed by a solemn procession of Saudi men in traditional dress. \n\nHe was later laid to rest after a simple, swift ceremony. Those present at the graveside -- the royals closest to the late king -- were then to move on to a royal palace, where they were to pay their respects to the new monarch. \n\nThe ceremony of \"al Bayaah,\" or pledging of allegiance to the new king, followed the funeral. \n\nCondolences and remembrances poured in from all corners of the globe. \n\n\"To God we belong and indeed to him we shall return,\" said the homepage of the English-language Saudi newspaper Arab News. \n\nBahrain, Jordan and the Palestinian territories, among others, declared days of mourning. The U.N. secretary-general praised Abdullah for his Arab Peace Initiative to end the Arab-Israeli conflict. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said he would lead a delegation \"in the coming days\" to pay respects. ",

It is the color of chalk and many bleached materials such as paper when they do not have added colorant. \n\nAccording to surveys in Europe and the United States, white is the color most often associated with perfection, the good, honesty, cleanliness, the beginning, the new, neutrality, and exactitude. White is an important color for almost all world religions. The Pope, the head of the Roman Catholic Church, has worn white since 1566, as a symbol of purity and sacrifice. In Islam, and in the Shinto religion of Japan, it is worn by pilgrims; and by the Brahmins in India. In Western cultures and in Japan, white is the most common color for wedding dresses, symbolizing purity and virginity. In many Asian cultures, white is also the color of mourning. \n\nIn ancient Egypt and ancient Rome, priestesses wore white as a symbol of purity, and Romans wore a white toga as a symbol of citizenship. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance a white unicorn symbolized chastity, and a white lamb sacrifice and purity. It was the royal color of the Kings of France, and of the monarchist movement that opposed the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War (1917\u20131922). Greek and Roman temples were faced with white marble, and beginning in the 18th century, with the advent of neoclassical architecture, white became the most common color of new churches, capitols and other government buildings, especially in the United States. It was also widely used in 20th century modern architecture as a symbol of modernity and simplicity.",

      "story": "Manganese is a chemical element with symbol Mn and atomic number 25. It is not found as a free element in nature; it is often found in minerals in combination with iron. Manganese is a metal with important industrial metal alloy uses, particularly in stainless steels. \n\nHistorically, manganese is named for pyrolusite and other black minerals from the region of Magnesia in Greece, which also gave its name to magnesium and the iron ore magnetite. By the mid-18th century, Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele had used pyrolusite to produce chlorine. Scheele and others were aware that pyrolusite (now known to be manganese dioxide) contained a new element, but they were unable to isolate it. Johan Gottlieb Gahn was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, which he did by reducing the dioxide with carbon. \n\nManganese phosphating is used for rust and corrosion prevention on steel. Ionized manganese is used industrially as pigments of various colors, which depend on the oxidation state of the ions. The permanganates of alkali and alkaline earth metals are powerful oxidizers. Manganese dioxide is used as the cathode (electron acceptor) material in zinc-carbon and alkaline batteries. \n\nIn biology, manganese(II) ions function as cofactors for a large variety of enzymes with many functions. Manganese enzymes are particularly essential in detoxification of superoxide free radicals in organisms that must deal with elemental oxygen. Manganese also functions in the oxygen-evolving complex of photosynthetic plants. While the element is a required trace mineral for all known living organisms, it also acts as a neurotoxin in larger amounts. Especially through inhalation, it can cause manganism, a condition in mammals leading to neurological damage that is sometimes irreversible.",

      "story": "In October, Ubayd Steed, a sixth grader in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was taking a math test when he noticed a classmate looking at his paper. \" I quickly turned my paper over,\" he said. Later that day, Ubayd met the cheater and told him not to do it again. Unfortunately, Ubayd' s experience is not unusual. Whether it's kids copying class -mates' answers during tests or friends sharing homework, cheating happens in schools every day. Experts say the behavior starts in the lower grades. Surveys show that one in three elementary students admits to cheating. Jacob Harder, a fourth grader in Ware, Massachusetts, has had classmates ask to copy his homework. \"I wouldn't want to just tell them the answers,\" he says. So instead, he explains the task and encourages his classmates to do it themselves. But many kids find it hard to say no. \"l hear from kids all the time, ' I can' t say no to a friend,'\" says Eric Anderman, a professor at The Ohio State University who studies cheating in school. He says it' s important to say no from the start. \"Then you _ , and the other kid gets the message,\" he says. Plus, he points out, \"a real friend is not going to disown you because he or she couldn't copy your math homework.\" The kids doing the copying may feel they need to cheat to be accepted by other kids. And some students may cheat simply because others do. \"If you' re in an atmosphere where cheating is common, you may think that if you don' t cheat, you' re at a disadvantage,\" says Michael Josephson, founder of the Josephson Institute of Ethics. But Josephson says students shouldn't think that way. \"There are a lot of things kids do,\" he says. \"You have to decide what kind of person you' re going to be.\" When school becomes too challenging, Anderman suggests going to the teacher rather than relying on the work of others. \"It' s good to ask for help,\" he says.",

It has an area of nearly and its population is estimated at 1.5 million people. Its capital and largest city is Libreville. \n\nSince its independence from France in 1960, Gabon has had three presidents. In the early 1990s, Gabon introduced a multi-party system and a new democratic constitution that allowed for a more transparent electoral process and reformed many governmental institutions. Gabon was also a temporary member of the United Nations Security Council for the 2010\u20132011 term. \n\nAbundant petroleum and foreign private investment have helped make Gabon one of the most prosperous countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, with the 4th highest HDI and the third highest GDP per capita (PPP) (after Equatorial Guinea and Botswana) in the region. GDP grew by more than 6% per year from 2010 to 2012. However, because of inequality in income distribution, a significant proportion of the population remains poor. Gabon's name originates from \"gab\u00e3o\", Portuguese for \"cloak\", which is roughly the shape of the estuary of the Komo River by Libreville.",

When he did, he hit his elbow on the table. Ouch! He rubbed his elbow and frowned. Then he put his shoes on his feet, washed his hands, put on a jacket. \n\nJacob felt better, and went to open the door to the back yard. He walked outside. Once he got outside, he felt the cool breeze and the warm sun. They made him feel sleepy. He thought he would take a nap outside on the deck. He pushed two chairs together to make a bed. He climbed up and lay down. He used Pet's toy frog as a pillow. He lay his head on it. Pet curled up next to the chairs to take a nap too. \n\nWhile Jacob and Pet slept, a bumblebee came flying by. It made a sleepy humming noise, and thought that the deck looked like a nice place to take a nap. A robin who had been following the bumblebee stopped too. The robin and the bee snuggled up together on the picnic table. \n\nJacob's mother looked out the window and saw Jacob, Pet, the bumblebee, and the robin all sleeping. \"What a peaceful group,\" she thought. And then she yawned and said, \"Now I am feeling sleepy too!\"",

This is highway robbery!\" stormed Captain Grady. \n\nHe struggled fiercely to regain his feet. But Blowfen was the stronger of the pair and he easily held the rascal down with one hand, while with the other he brought several letters from his inside pocket. \n\nPaul eagerly snatched the letters, in spite of the captain's protest. He glanced at them, with Chet looking over his shoulder. \n\n\"Well, what do you make out?\" asked Caleb Dottery. He didn't quite like the way matters were turning. \n\n\"I think we will be safe in making Captain Grady a prisoner,\" replied Paul slowly. \n\n\"Yes, make him a prisoner by all means,\" put in Chet. \"He is a villain if ever there was one. If we can't prove it I think my Uncle Barnaby can.\" \n\nAt the reference to Barnaby Winthrop Captain Grady grew pale. It was evident that his sins were at last finding him out. \n\nIt did not take Jack Blowfen long to act upon Paul's suggestion. He disarmed the captain and made him march into the house, where he bound the fellow in very much the same manner as Dottery had bound Jeff Jones. \n\nWhile he was doing so Paul showed the letters taken from the prisoner to Caleb Dottery. Chet, while a second reading was going on, commenced to ransack the house. ",

I went to the show's website to see for myself. My mom was right. At a time when even Barbara Walters says she's really bored with celebrities interviews, this one will not disappoint. \n\nIt's the story of Derek Paravicini, a 30-year-old who was born three months early, physically disabled (he can't button his own shirt), blind, and severely autistic . \n\nYet, through total luck and coincidence, his family discovered that Derek had a remarkable musical talent when he was three. \n\nDerek can hear any musical composition one time and play it perfectly on the piano. \n\nThat's right. He only has to hear it once. \n\nEven more unbelievable, his brain, like a computer, can keep many songs that he can immediately repeat when asked. But his talent isn't limited to just learning things by heart. Derek is a true musical genius and artist who plays beautifully in a wide range of styles and can make his own music. \n\nWith his talent, Derek has raised millions of dollars putting on charity concerts. He also donates his time to senior centers where he acts as a human jukebox machine, taking requests from senior citizens who haven't heard their favorite songs for decades. \n\nAs it turns out, Derek loves people and his extraordinary talent has been the key to unlocking his personality and social development. \n\nIf you want to inspire your family, pop some popcorn and sit everyone down to watch this excellent piece of journalism. If your kids are like mine, it will cause a great family discussion about the definition of \"disability\" and the extraordinary ability of the human brain and spirit. It may even give you the perfect answer the next time your child says he or she \"can't\" do something. Now that's priceless. \n\nWho says there's nothing good on TV?",

Communities across the United States will host parades , parties, and other festivities to mark the occasion. \n\nThis year, cities like Boston, New York, and Chicago have organized big events celebrating Saint Patrick's Day. In New York City, hundreds of thousands of people will gather to watch the Saint Patrick's Day parade-the nation's largest. It is one of the most watched parades in the world. Last year, almost 2 million watched it , more than 150,000 took part in it and they filled the streets. The parade, first held in 1776, is also one of the oldest. \n\nChicago also throws a big celebration. Every year, the Chicago River, which crosses the city, shines green as event organizers pour about 40 pounds of fluorescence, a powerful dye , into the water. \n\nBoston keeps its parade rolling for three hours or more. It is the nation's second-largest parade. The city will also show respect to one of its most famous former residents, President John F. Kennedy, by opening the exhibit \"A Journey Home:John F. Kennedy and Ireland\", at his official library. \n\nPatron Saint lived in Britain in the early fifth century, when it was still part of the Roman Empire. He was caught and sold into slavery in Ireland when he was only 16. He finally escaped slavery and turned to a life of religious devotion. He trained to become a minister and set out to spread Christianity throughout Ireland. After 30 years as a religious leader, Patrick died on March 17, 1461. Saint Patrick's Day is always celebrated on March 17. In Ireland, it is an official holiday.",

      "story": "Bollywood formally known as Hindi cinema is the Indian Hindi language film industry, based in the city of Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. Bollywood is only a part of the larger cinema of India also known as Indywood, which includes other production centers producing blockbuster films in many other Indian languages. \n\nBy revenue, Bollywood is the largest film producer in India, representing 43% of the net box office, while Telugu and Tamil cinema represent 36%, and the rest of the regional cinema constitutes 21% as of 2014. Bollywood is also one of the largest centers of film production in the world. Furthermore, Bollywood is one of the biggest film industries in the world in terms of the number of people employed and the number of films produced. According to J. Matusitz and P. Payano, in 2011, over 3.5 billion tickets were sold across the globe, which in comparison is 900,000 tickets more than Hollywood. Bollywood produced 252 films in 2014 out of a total of 1969 films produced in Indian cinema. \n\nThe name \"Bollywood\" is a portmanteau derived from Bombay (the former name for Mumbai) and Hollywood (in California), the center of the American film industry. The naming scheme for \"Bollywood\" was inspired by \"Tollywood\", the name that was used to refer to the cinema of West Bengal. Dating back to 1932, \"Tollywood\" was the earliest Hollywood-inspired name, referring to the Bengali film industry based in Tollygunge (in Calcutta, West Bengal), whose name is reminiscent of \"Hollywood\" and was the centre of the cinema of India at the time. It was this \"chance juxtaposition of two pairs of rhyming syllables,\" Holly and Tolly, that led to the portmanteau name \"Tollywood\" being coined. The name \"Tollywood\" went on to be used as a nickname for the Bengali film industry by the popular Calcutta-based \"Junior Statesman\" youth magazine, establishing a precedent for other film industries to use similar-sounding names, eventually leading to the coining of \"Bollywood\". \"Tollywood\" is now also popularly used to refer to the Telugu film industry in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.",

      "story": "(CNN)\"A long, long, time ago...\" \n\nThose five words, when uttered or sung, makes baby boomers immediately think of Don McLean's pop masterpiece \"American Pie.\" It's hard to believe that his phenomenal 8\u00bd minute allegory, which millions of Americans know by heart, is 44 years old. All sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song, brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus, which starts as \"Bye, Bye, Miss American Pie.\" There is no real way to categorize McLean's \"American Pie\" for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad, beer-hall chant and high-art rock. \n\nOn Tuesday, Christie's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song's lyrics for $1.2 million to an unnamed buyer. \n\nMcLean was a paperboy when, on February 3, 1959, he saw that Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in Clear Lake, Iowa. \"The next day I went to school in shock and guess what?\" McLean recalled. \"Nobody cared. Rock 'n' roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and Buddy hadn't had a big hit on the charts since '57.\" By cathartically writing \"American Pie,\" McLean has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever. \n\nHaving recorded his first album, \"Tapestry,\" in 1969, in Berkeley, California, during the student riots, McLean, a native New Yorker, became a kind of weather vane for what he called the \"generation lost in space.\" When his cultural anthem \"American Pie\" was released in November 1971, it replaced Bob Dylan's \"The Times They Are A Changin\" as the Peoples Almanac of the new decade. It's important to think of \"American Pie\" as one would of Henry Longfellow's \"Evangeline\" or Johnny Mercer's \"Moon River\" -- an essential Americana poem emanating wistful recollection, blues valentine, and youthful protest rolled into one. There is magic brewing in the music and words of \"American Pie,\" for McLean's lyrics and melody frame a cosmic dream, like those Jack Kerouac tried to conjure in his poetry-infused novel \"On the Road.\" ",

      "story": "British writer John Bunyan was born at Elstow, Bedfordshire, England, in November, 1628. His father was a maker and mender of pots and kettles, and the son followed the same trade. Though he is usually called a tinker, Bunyan had a settled home and place of business. He had little schooling, and he describes his early surroundings as poor and mean. He became much interested in religions, but it was only after a tremendous spiritual conflict, lasting three or four years, that he found peace. His struggles are related with extraordinary vividness and intensity in his \"Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners.\" His writing began with a controversy against the Quakers , and shows from the first the command of a homely but vigorous style. \n\nLike most working men at the time, Bunyan had a deep hatred for the corrupted, hypocritical rich who accumulated their wealth \"by hook and by crook.\" As a stout Puritan , he had made a conscientious study of the Bible and firmly believed in salvation through spiritual struggle. \n\nBunyan's style was modeled after that of the English Bible. With his concrete and living language and carefully observed and vividly presented details, he made it possible for the reader of the least education to share the pleasure of reading his novel and to relive the experience of his characters. \n\nBunyan's works include Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners (1666), The Life and Death of Mr. Badman (1680), The Holy War (1682) and The Pilgrim's Progress (1684). \n\nThe Pilgrim's Progress is the most successful religious allegory in the English language. Its purpose is to urge people to observe Christian doctrines and seek salvation through constant struggle with their own weaknesses and all kinds of social evils. It is not only about something spiritual but also bears much relevance to the time. Its predominant metaphor -- life as a journey -- is simple and familiar. The objects that Christian meets are homely and commonplace, and the scenes presented are typical English ones, but throughout the allegory a spiritual significance is added to the commonplace details. Here the strange is combined with the familiar and the trivial joined to the divine, and, a rich imagination and a natural talent for storytelling also contribute to the success of the work which is at once entertaining and morally instructive. \n\n\"The Vanity Fair,\" is an excerpt from The Pilgrim's Progress. The story starts with a dream in which the author sees Christian the Pilgrim, with a heavy burden on his back, reading the Bible. When he learns from the book that the city in which he and his family live shall be burnt down in a fire, Christian tries to convince his family and his neighbors of the oncoming disaster and asks them to go with him in search of salvation, but most of them simply ignore him. So he starts off with a friend, Pliable. Pliable turns back after they stumble into a pit, the Slough of Despond. Christian struggles on by himself. Then he is misled by Mr. Wordly Wiseman and is brought back onto the right road by Mr. Evangelist. There he joins Faithful, a neighbor who has set out later but has made better progress. The two go on together through many adventures, including the great struggle with Apollyon, who claims them to be his subjects and refuse to accept their allegiance to God. After many other adventures they come to the Vanity Fair where both are arrested as alien agitators. They are tried and Faithful is condemned to death. Christian, however manages to escape and goes on his way, assisted by a new friend, Hopeful. Tired of the hard journey, they are tempted to take pleasant path and are then captured by Giant Despair. Finally they get away and reach the Celestial City, where they enjoy eternal life in the fellowship of the blessed.",

Then they went to buy a couch. Jerry worked at the couch store. Lily found a green couch that she liked. But the couch was too hard. Rose found a soft red couch. She showed it to Lilly and they both thought it was very soft. Jerry said he would help them move it and let them buy the couch. Rose and Lily went to another store to buy extra cushions. Tom worked at the store that had a lot of pillows to buy. Rose and Lily did not think Tom was nice. Tom did not help them. Rose found red pillows but Tom would not give them to her. Lily found pretty green pillows but Tom said they cost a lot of money. Rose and Lily went to another store where they met Steve and Megan. Steve and Megan showed them a lot of pillows that were nice. Rose and Lily showed Megan and Steve the couch they had. Megan and Steve helped find pretty blue pillows for the red couch. Rose and Lily were so happy they threw a party. Megan and Steve went to the party. Jerry went too. Jerry went to the party and gave Megan and Lily a rug. It was blue. The rug matched the pillows.",

      "story": "CHAPTER XIII \n\nSHOCKS ALL ROUND \n\nBillie had been standing near the wall, inspecting a portrait of the late Mr. Josiah Appleby, of which the kindest thing one can say is that one hopes it did not do him justice. She now shrank back against this wall, as if she were trying to get through it. The edge of the portrait's frame tilted her hat out of the straight, but in this supreme moment she did not even notice it. \n\n\"Er--how do you do?\" she said. \n\nIf she had not been an exceedingly pretty girl, one would have said that she spoke squeakily. The fighting spirit of the Bennetts, though it was considerable fighting spirit, had not risen to this emergency. It had ebbed out of her, leaving in its place a cold panic. She had seen this sort of thing in the movies--there was one series of pictures, \"The Dangers of Diana,\" where something of the kind had happened to the heroine in every reel--but she had not anticipated that it would ever happen to her; and consequently she had not thought out any plan for coping with such a situation. A grave error. In this world one should be prepared for everything, or where is one? \n\n\"I've brought the revolver,\" said Mr. Peters. \n\n\"So--so I see!\" said Billie. \n\nMr. Peters nursed the weapon affectionately in his hand. He was rather a shy man with women as a rule, but what Sam had told him about her being interested in his revolver had made his heart warm to this girl. ",

Though a fire burned on the hearth by which he lounged, cigarette in hand, two of the tall windows were open and the air that flowed in was soft and muggy. He had spent most of the day in shooting, and after a long walk across wet meadows and a boggy moor he now felt very comfortable and somewhat drowsy. He would have to bestir himself when the guests he expected arrived, and he was enjoying a few minutes' rest. His cigarette was, however, only half smoked when Wannop walked in. \n\n\"As I didn't see you downstairs I came up to look for you; Gertrude's with Hilda. Haven't Florence and Leonard arrived yet?\" \n\n\"Train seems to be late,\" Andrew replied. \"I suppose I should have gone to meet them, but I felt lazy.\" \n\n\"Was that all?\" \n\n\"It wasn't my only reason. To tell the truth, I shirked the drive home with Leonard. I'm a poor dissembler and our relations are rather strained. It will be easier to meet him when there are others about.\" \n\n\"They'll be on his side.\" \n\n\"I expect so; but I'm not afraid of direct opposition. It's beating about a delicate subject and trying to keep on safe ground that bothers me.\" \n\n\"I know; it's embarrassing.

      "story": "(CNN) -- When did conservatives become prisoners to idiotic vulgarity? I ask that question as someone who self-defines as conservative and who is sick and tired of being embarrassed by Ted Nugent. \n\nLast month the aged rocker called President Barack Obama a \"subhuman mongrel\" in an interview with Guns.com. That was bad enough, but what was just as shocking was the willingness of Texas GOP gubernatorial nominee Greg Abbott to keep him aboard his campaign. \n\nRick Perry and Ted Cruz also failed to rule out appearing with him. Only Rand Paul took to Twitter to demand an apology, which Nugent eventually gave. He downgraded Obama to a \"liar,\" which is, at least, a more colorblind insult. \n\nThere is a view that Nugent simply \"speaks his mind,\" and, yes, he has every constitutionally guaranteed right to do so. Maybe what he says appeals to some people, those for whom good manners are a bourgeois affectation and correct spelling the preserve of Harvard pointy-heads. \n\nNugent insists comments not racist, promises to stop 'calling people names' \n\nEither way, what is disturbing is that some serious Republican politicians think that he matters and are happy to count him among their endorsements -- as though selling records and getting angry make him a spokesman for the masses. Animal from the Muppets also speaks his mind, but we've yet to see him headlining a rally for Chris Christie. \n\nThis isn't what conservatism is supposed to be about. Conservatism is the rejection of ideology in favor of common sense and anger in favor of cool rationalism. ",

His parents said he had experienced years of bullying over his sexual orientation. His suicide has attracted the attention of such stars as Lady Gaga, who dedicated a song to him at a recent concert. \n\nThe \"It Gets Better\" campaign is aimed at gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered youth who may experience bullying. \n\n\"Our society needs to recognize the unstoppable momentum toward unequivocal civil equality for every gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered citizen of this country,\" Quinto said. \"Gay kids need to stop killing themselves because they are made to feel worthless by cruel and relentless bullying. Parents need to teach their children principles of respect and acceptance. We are witnessing an enormous shift of collective consciousness throughout the world. I believe in the power of intention to change the landscape of our society -- and it is my intention to live an authentic life of compassion and integrity and action.\" ",

He climbed up and lay down. He used Pet's toy frog as a pillow. He lay his head on it. Pet curled up next to the chairs to take a nap too. \n\nWhile Jacob and Pet slept, a bumblebee came flying by. It made a sleepy humming noise, and thought that the deck looked like a nice place to take a nap. A robin who had been following the bumblebee stopped too.

      "story": "British writer John Bunyan was born at Elstow, Bedfordshire, England, in November, 1628. His father was a maker and mender of pots and kettles, and the son followed the same trade. Though he is usually called a tinker, Bunyan had a settled home and place of business. He had little schooling, and he describes his early surroundings as poor and mean. He became much interested in religions, but it was only after a tremendous spiritual conflict, lasting three or four years, that he found peace. His struggles are related with extraordinary vividness and intensity in his \"Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners.\" His writing began with a controversy against the Quakers , and shows from the first the command of a homely but vigorous style. \n\nLike most working men at the time, Bunyan had a deep hatred for the corrupted, hypocritical rich who accumulated their wealth \"by hook and by crook.\" As a stout Puritan , he had made a conscientious study of the Bible and firmly believed in salvation through spiritual struggle. \n\nBunyan's style was modeled after that of the English Bible. With his concrete and living language and carefully observed and vividly presented details, he made it possible for the reader of the least education to share the pleasure of reading his novel and to relive the experience of his characters. \n\nBunyan's works include Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners (1666), The Life and Death of Mr. Badman (1680), The Holy War (1682) and The Pilgrim's Progress (1684). \n\nThe Pilgrim's Progress is the most successful religious allegory in the English language. Its purpose is to urge people to observe Christian doctrines and seek salvation through constant struggle with their own weaknesses and all kinds of social evils. It is not only about something spiritual but also bears much relevance to the time. Its predominant metaphor -- life as a journey -- is simple and familiar. The objects that Christian meets are homely and commonplace, and the scenes presented are typical English ones, but throughout the allegory a spiritual significance is added to the commonplace details. Here the strange is combined with the familiar and the trivial joined to the divine, and, a rich imagination and a natural talent for storytelling also contribute to the success of the work which is at once entertaining and morally instructive. \n\n\"The Vanity Fair,\" is an excerpt from The Pilgrim's Progress. The story starts with a dream in which the author sees Christian the Pilgrim, with a heavy burden on his back, reading the Bible. When he learns from the book that the city in which he and his family live shall be burnt down in a fire, Christian tries to convince his family and his neighbors of the oncoming disaster and asks them to go with him in search of salvation, but most of them simply ignore him. So he starts off with a friend, Pliable. Pliable turns back after they stumble into a pit, the Slough of Despond. Christian struggles on by himself. Then he is misled by Mr. Wordly Wiseman and is brought back onto the right road by Mr. Evangelist. There he joins Faithful, a neighbor who has set out later but has made better progress. The two go on together through many adventures, including the great struggle with Apollyon, who claims them to be his subjects and refuse to accept their allegiance to God. After many other adventures they come to the Vanity Fair where both are arrested as alien agitators. They are tried and Faithful is condemned to death. Christian, however manages to escape and goes on his way, assisted by a new friend, Hopeful. Tired of the hard journey, they are tempted to take pleasant path and are then captured by Giant Despair. Finally they get away and reach the Celestial City, where they enjoy eternal life in the fellowship of the blessed.",

They liked to play there because of the giant trees, which were more fun to play in at nighttime. One evening, after a big meal of chicken and potatoes at Molly's house the girls went outside to play hide and go seek. They almost turned back because they thought they saw a wolf. Luckily, it ended up being a shadow from an old boot. Jessica counted to fifty to give Molly time to hide. In the middle of counting, Jessica heard a sound! Jessica opened up her eyes to see Molly had found a puppy! The puppy had a bell on its collar, so the girls knew it must belong to someone. They carried the puppy back to Molly's house instead of playing hide and go seek. As soon as they got to Molly's front door, Molly's neighbor saw them and screamed with joy. The puppy ran over to Molly's neighbor and licked her face. The neighbor thanked the two girls by giving them each a folded five dollar bill. The girls were very excited that they helped save the day!",

Though a fire burned on the hearth by which he lounged, cigarette in hand, two of the tall windows were open and the air that flowed in was soft and muggy. He had spent most of the day in shooting, and after a long walk across wet meadows and a boggy moor he now felt very comfortable and somewhat drowsy. He would have to bestir himself when the guests he expected arrived, and he was enjoying a few minutes' rest. His cigarette was, however, only half smoked when Wannop walked in. \n\n\"As I didn't see you downstairs I came up to look for you; Gertrude's with Hilda.

      "story": "The word pharmacy is derived from its root word pharma which was a term used since the 15th\u201317th centuries. However, the original Greek roots from pharmakos imply sorcery or even poison. In addition to pharma responsibilities, the pharma offered general medical advice and a range of services that are now performed solely by other specialist practitioners, such as surgery and midwifery. The pharma (as it was referred to) often operated through a retail shop which, in addition to ingredients for medicines, sold tobacco and patent medicines. Often the place that did this was called an apothecary and several languages have this as the dominant term, though their practices are more akin to a modern pharmacy, in English the term apothecary would today be seen as outdated or only approproriate if herbal remedies were on offer to a large extent. The pharmas also used many other herbs not listed. The Greek word Pharmakeia (Greek: \u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03b1) derives from pharmakon (\u03c6\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd), meaning \"drug\", \"medicine\" (or \"poison\").[n 1]",

It surfaced Monday after his funeral, and was posted on YouTube and distributed to other media outlets by the newspaper El Periodico de Guatemala. \n\nRosenberg's video said he was targeted for talking about the death of prominent businessman Khalil Musa and his daughter in April.

One day at lunch time, I was getting ready to eat my tuna fish sandwich and suddenly Mrs Elise asked me if she could buy my sandwich from me. She explained that I could use the money to buy a hot hunch from the cafeteria . I was excited. I never bought my lunch at the cafeteria. It was too expensive for my family, and I always carried my lunch and took the bag back home to use it again the next day. So you could understand my happiness when I had the chance to buy a hot lunch. When we finished lunch that day, Mrs Elise took me aside and said she wanted to explain why she had bought my sandwich. I really didn't care why, but it gave me a few minutes of her special attention, so I was quiet as she explained. She told me that she was a Catholic and Catholics didn't eat red meat on Fridays, they ate fish on Fridays. Oh, I couldn't wait to get home and tell my mother that from then on I wanted a tuna fish sandwich on Fridays. After my mother understood why, she gladly made tuna fish sandwiches for me on Fridays. She even made it with brown bread because she knew Mrs Elise liked brown bread. From then on, every Friday I could get in line with other kids for a hot lunch. I didn't care how many of the kids complained about cafeteria food. It tasted _ to me! I realize now that Mrs Elise could have made herself tuna fish sandwiches on Fridays. But she bought mine because she saw a little girl who was excited at the simple act of having a hot lunch. I will never forget Mrs Elise for her pity for me and generosity and what I should do is to follow her example.",

But once you were there, I found, you were in. \n\nGlobe jobs were for life-guaranteed until retirement. For 15 years I had prospered there--moving from an ordinary reporter to senior editor. I would have a lifetime of security if I stuck with it. Instead, I had made a decision to leave. I entered my boss's office. Would he be angry? I wondered. He had a famous temper. \"Matt, we have to have a talk,\" I began. \"I came to the Globe when I was twenty-four. Now I' m forty. There' s a lot I want to do in life. I'm resigning. \" \"To another paper?\" he asked. I reached into my coat pocket, but didn't say anything. I handed him a letter that explained everything. It said that I was leaving to start a new media company. We were at a rare turning point in history. I wanted to be directly engaged in the change. \"I' m glad for you,\" he said, quite out of my expectation. \"I just came from a board of directors meeting and it was seventy-five percent discouraging news. Some of that we can deal with. But much of it we can' t,\" he went on. \"I wish you all the luck in the world,\" he concluded. \"And if it doesn't work out, remember, there is always a place here for you.\" \n\nThen I went out of his office, walking through the newsroom for more good-byes. Everybody was saying congratulations. Everybody--even though I'd be risking all the financial security I had carefully built up. \n\nLater, I had a final talk with Bill Taylor, chairman and publisher of the Boston Globe. He had turned the Globe into a billion-dollar property. \"I' m resigning, Bill,\" I said. He listened while I gave him the story. He wasn't looking angry either.

Then he melted the chocolate. He mixed the egg whites until they made a thick foam. He mixed the egg yolks with the sugar. But as he was ready to mix everything, his boss asked him to do a different job. Paul chopped some vegetables. \n\nWhen he came back, Greg had taken over his work and made a mistake. The mix was much too thin. It looked like chocolate soup. It wouldn't rise at all. Luckily Paul was ready. He had practiced the dessert recipe before. It looked like it didn't have enough egg whites. Paul separated more eggs and mixed the egg whites. He added the extra egg whites to the mix. His addition worked. The desserts rose high in the oven. He saved the day!",

      "story": "Liverpool is famed for many things -- most especially The Beatles and its football team. But few would associate the city with one of the most famous political speeches in history. Yet tourism officials in the city have published the claim that Martin Luther King's \"I Have a Dream\" was written at a city centre hotel. The allegation has been made in a guide to a major art event named Liverpool Discovers. \n\nA map in the guide shows more than 20 locations where famous people were born along with places associated with celebrities and events in their life. The guide claims, \"Martin Luther King visited his supporters in Liverpool three times, and the first draft of his famous speech 'I Have a Dream' is claimed to have been written at Adelphi Hotel.\" The speech, delivered to civil rights campaigners on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington in 1963, is one of the most quoted texts in history and was a definitive moment in the American Civil Rights Movement and in the fight for racial equality. \n\nDr. King's biographer, Godfrey Hodgson, said that the suggestion did not fit the facts. He said, \"I don't believe it. If he had been to Liverpool, there would have been massive media reports, as he would have been a big figure by then. Dr. King did visit the UK on a number of occasions but he was not in the UK around the time of this famous speech in 1963.\"Prof. John Belcham, a history lecturer of University of Liverpool who wrote an 800year history of Liverpool in 2008, confirmed that he was unaware of any connection between Dr. King and the city.",
